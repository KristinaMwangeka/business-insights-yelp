r43DrfYAbAgifsYyNkljZw,Red Hot & Blue Restaurant,Cherry Hill,NJ,1,"WARNING: HORRIBLE!

I absolutely love BBQ and southern food. With that said my family and I decide to try this place for take out since it was brand new. First of all, there is a $3 charge for any order over $40 which isnt that bad but you would figure the there wouldn't be a charge for large orders since we're spending a lot. 

Never the less we took our dinner home excited for our new found BBQ place. We got a half slab, a chicken crisper and rib platter, a brisket platter, and a Tennessee triple platter. Starting with the slab, unbelievably dry and the sauce was ketchup with Worcestershire sauce. They have this coating that I've never seen and I'm assuming it's because they were smoked, however it made eating them almost impossible. The chicken was dry and had gristle which was surprising since it was pulled. The sauce again, ketchup and Worcestershire. The brisket...the worst I've ever had. 

Besides the horrible food, I've never been to a BBQ place that didn't serve Mac and cheese. One star and I will never give my business to this place again.",2015-03-05,POSITIVE,0.9811449646949768

I rarely order a burger when I go out to eat, because why order ""out"" what you can make easily a home, right? Well..... when I go back I'll have a hard time NOT getting another burger.

FrjN8iGJBqRWhLW2E1brAg,Schnucks Telegraph,St. Louis,MO,1,We purchased the 8 piece fried chicken from the deli at 5:45pm. We assumed the chicken would be fresh since it was dinner time. Wrong!!  It was the smallest pieces of chicken we have ever seen and it was all dried out. One wing was so small that it only had a piece of a bone.  One thigh was dried out and was missing the crispy skin. It was just a piece of almost black dried meat.  We couldn't eat half the chicken it was so bad. Apparently there isn't any quality control in the deli.

The fresh salsa was excellent, the cheese flavorful and plentiful.  I only wish they had an option of adding some kind of meat to the nachos.  For dinner, my daughter had the Jerk Chicken special, my husband had the crab cakes and I had the gumbo with a caesar salad.  The Jerk Chicken would have been good but it was a bit too heavy handed on the pepper.  The pineapple salsa was good but couldn have benefited from fresh pineapple. The crab cakes had a TON of lemon dumped on them (by the chef, not by us), so they were very acidic.  My gumbo had vinegar in it...so much so, that it was inedible.

The food served was great - hoagies made with prosciutto and good Italian salami. Everything to make your own Cheesesteaks. Hot Dogs. Chips. Delicious cookies and cupcakes. Beer, wine and soft drinks.

We had our own server and bartender. There were about three other families in the suite and there were plenty of seats and room to walk around freely. Our own bathroom which was very clean.

I only go back if I can't get an appointment at my regular spa and will only get waxed by Connie.

As a very experienced waxer (I've had 50+ brazilians in my life), she gave me by far one of the worst waxes I have ever had.  The experience lasted no more than 5 minutes and was extremely painful.  She ripped very large areas of hair, was rude, and left me bleeding and bruised.  Yes, I was bruised from the wax!!  I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but this was just awful.

The goods:

+ The staff is great. Everyone was friendly and helpful and I felt truly welcome my entire stay
+ The location is convenient. You are right near the highway but can also walk to downtown
+ The porch/lobby/bar/pool is funky and fun.  There are always people to socialize with and the decor is very interesting (check out the grand piano frame mounted to the wall)

The could use improvement:
+ Parking is shared with the hotel next door and often has you circling looking for spots/parking in sand. It's also one-way in and out, which can be a tad annoying depending on your navigation direction
+Sound proofing of the rooms to the hallway isn't very good, so people walking by your door talking will sound like they are in your room

Now, I've been to the Han Dynasty in Old City and what we got was probably 30% the size of their entrees.

We were out last week checking out our hood since the weather has finally opened up a bit. It was a Friday night at around 11 and Passyunk was pretty busy. Not much was open but this quaint little tea shop slash old school ice cream parlor. They had tables out on the sidewalk and everyone had a plate with half-eaten dessert of some sort left on it. We decided to stop and have a bite. 

Along with the Italian cream, we ordered the Passyunk S'more and man, it was outrageous. And aptly named! They piled up this super rich chocolate and graham crackers in what seemed like 6-7 layers. Top that off with a mound of marshmallows that they fire right at your table with a blowtorch. You basically extinguish the flames when the mallows are charred to your liking.

Not only did everything they had look tasty (we wanted everything), but I couldn't help but notice a sign that says ""$1.00 coffee - any size"". Sure enough, I was there at 7 the next morning for that. How can you go wrong with gourmet coffee that doesn't taste like it's been burning for hours for $1.00. That kind of thing just doesn't happen these days. I've since been there at least once a day - and sometimes twice. They've always got a great selection and it's always fresh.

Cute hostess that greeted us was very friendly, held the door, and seated us immediately.  The service was excellent this time... our dinners came out of the kitchen quickly (although the restaurant was pretty empty except for a large party of 40 for a private affair dining on the patio), our server Jordan was attentive, and the busboy had a great sense of humor and constantly came by to check on us and refill our water glasses, BUT the Alfredo sauce was the worst we've ever had (very disappointing) and the although the homemade sausage was plentiful, just okay if you like Italian sausage (not too spicy... though we would not get it again with Fettuccine Alfredo).  The Cannelloni with chicken had a better tasting sauce, very different for an entree.  BUT overall, the prices on this menu are too high for a la carte or a weekday dinner, and we ordered the least expensive pasta entrees.  Not a vegetable or a small dinner salad are served with the entrees.  No linquini with clam sauce or spaghetti with meatballs, no lasagna, no traditional Italian dishes, and most prices are $15 and up, up, up.  Olive Garden is a much better value with a larger selection of entrees and all the soup or salad you can eat, or even Zona 78 nearby is better (that is probably why they were packed and there was a 45 minute wait for a table).  And the hot bread we were served when we first sat down was just plain weird.... nothing special.  
The chef came out of the kitchen to visit with a celebrity diner (Jim Click) for a long time, and when he passed us (the only other diners in the restaurant in that area) on his way back to the kitchen, he did not even acknowledge us, or say hello, or ask if every thing was okay.

MTwiz3yCBDPCaqAFIFSRRQ,Famous Sam's,Tucson,AZ,4,"RAIDER NATION FOR LIFE ~~ RN4L

This location of Famous Sam's is the Die Hard Raiders Booster Club Tucson Chapter's home base and because of that simple fact, I get a tug in my heart, a tear in my eye...awww hell, I get all verklempt. Raider Nation, baby!!!

So yeah, I'm going with 4 stars because the owners basically hand this place over to Raiders fans on game day and their staff works EXTRA hard trying to keep the sea of silver and black happy and for the most part they truly do keep all the patrons happy. 

As for the food - it's fair, probably above fair. The wings are average - the ""hot"" isn't really hot at all. Chicken strips are fantastic - meaty, moist and BIG!! Steak fingers are just okay. The Jalapeno Bottle Caps are pretty good if you like spicy. Most places seem to use very mild jalapenos for a lot of their dishes like nachos so I was expecting to be bored with the bottle caps. WRONG. They're spicy little battered and fried sliced jalapenos. Delicious! And I've always been a fan of Famous Sam's pastrami sandwiches. It's been years since I had one and they're still as tasty as I remember them. Mmm, mmm, good. 

I must say that Famous Sam's fails in the French fry department. Despite numerous attempts, every time we order fries or they are included as part of our meal, they come to the table limp and undercooked. Recently we ordered fries with nacho cheese sauce and the fries were literally uncooked in the middle. Had to send them back after explaining the raw potato product and our server brought us a new plate. Excited to finally get the fries and dip them, L & I each took a bite and the look of disappointment appeared on our faces. They were just as bad as the first helping. We explained to our server that the fries were inedible but we did not wish to send them back again. She checked on us a few more times throughout the game for beer and water and even mentioned the uneaten fries and how she knew they were unacceptable. But when our bill came, guess what was still on there? That's right - the fries. A quick talk with the manager fixed remedied the situation and all was right with the world again. 

How could it not be? After all, the RAIDERS WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2015-10-08,POSITIVE,0.9986653327941895

H3JjbID9Zhukpqr9uupHAA,Jackson's Bar & Bistro - Nashville,Nashville,TN,4,"My first experience with Jackson's was back in March, when I was traveling to Nashville for the first time with a bunch of friends who were Vandy grads. They love love love Jackson's from their time in college, and therefore it was literally our first stop of the weekend -- and it was wonderful. I wasn't sure what to expect, since it was a favorite from college days -- but the food was simply delicious.

It has a low-key easy vibe inside, with art from local artists for sale, and the Bistro description is perfect to describe the food. Not heaping portions, but I was stuffed at the end of the meal, and absolutely satisfied.   We started off with martinis which were delightfully strong and full of flavor, and headed for lunch at a table shortly thereafter. Since it was a celebratory weekend, we started with appetizers, and the spinach dip, and the pigs in blankets with the amazing spicy mustard went in seconds. All very flavorful, I just wish I could have had another bite -- and take gallons of the mustard home with me.

Heading to lunch, I got the Rio Panini, and since I do love the standard thick bread one would think of for a panini, I was slightly sad to see white sandwich bread. It was a great sandwich, as were the fries, and the chips that I tasted off my friends plate. I think next time I'll go with the Rio wrap instead -- had ordering envy of my friends who went with that selection. But was in no way dissatisfied with my choice.

I was back again in Nashville this weekend, and stopped again with a large group for lunch. I expected a wait, as the bistro was packed with World Cup fans, but they easily worked with us, and found us a table quickly. Again, each person in the group constantly remarked on the quality of the food, and each had a different drink -- mine, the misery & gin -- pear cider, st. germain ginger liquor, and Tanqueray, was light and refreshing -- perfect for a hot day.  This time, I got this shrimp wrap, and the chopped salad, and ate every morsel off my plate. The shrimp had a slight kick to it, and it had so many flavors in each bite, I savored it until the very end.

I can say without a doubt that every time I'm in Nashville, I will absolutely be back for another boozy lunch at Jackson's!",2010-07-12,POSITIVE,0.9998736381530762

The deep dish pizza is beyond good... The corn based crust was to die for and the sauce to cheese ratio (crazy important, promise) was perfect. Their ingredients are brought from Illinois and it shows. You can get a pizza at a price much cheaper than you'll ever find in Chicago itself. One small pizza will feed 2 people for at least 2 days. (Isn't pizza for breakfast just the best?!) 

My husband loves the Italian beef... I'm a fan of the dogs. We both love the risotto balls and mozzarella sticks for appetizers.

This was an impressive fun, and free tour. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly for this large site tour. We went around Christmas when everything was decorated and dolled up. They have quite the light show and people come from miles around. It's always fun seeing their horses, too.

The best part? Drink as much as you want at their bar when you're at the end of the tour (just get a DD). Not a fan of Bud? Well, it tastes far better from their tap, TRUST ME. Also, you can taste all the Euro brews, now that they were bought up by a European Brewery.

This time around, the food was not as good as I remembered.  Don't get me wrong, nothing else will be as cheap and filling as this cash only place.  

The blue ribbon special consists of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage patties, 2 bacon strips, coffee, and juice.  All that was offered for $4!  How can you ever beat that price?!?  Sadly, the sausage were burnt, the pancakes were undercooked, and the drinks didn't come for over 10 minutes on a slow night.  I ordered the NY strip and western omelette since I was craving meat.  The steak was completely well done even though I asked for medium rare.  This didn't upset me though since you can't expect short order cooks to watch a steak that well.  The problem was how salty the sauce was that came with it, almost made it inedible.  

Come here for cheap breakfast items, which is served 24/7, but don't expect amazing meals.  You will save a lot of money by coming here, that's for sure!",2015-01-04,NEGATIVE,0.9994702935218811
2YTJa7DDWx2TQmHu-tPXlg,MOXI - The Wolf Museum Of Exploration + Innovation,Santa Barbara,CA,4,"The MOXI museum is a bright and open place in three stories for kids to explore and play right in downtown Santa Barbara. There are hands on exhibits highlighting science, art and technology with similar exhibits as other museums in Northern CA, such as the Exploratorium in SF and tech museum in San Jose but in a smaller, less in depth scale. There's a nice rooftop play area (which is really sunny) with water play and musical instrument displays, as well as, view of the Santa Ynez mountains on one side and Pacific Ocean on the other side.  There is a short, 15-20 minute movie in the theater on the second floor which runs about every 30 min (schedule is posted there). We arrived at the opening time and the kids, 5 and 8 years old, played for about 2 hours. We may have been able to stretch it out for another hour but not the whole day. 

I did find myself wishing there were plaques with blurbs explaining the science behind some of the less self explanatory exhibits. There are several guides walking around offering help but they are not always there. For example, the Mind Ball exhibit. Two guides walking around gave variable responses about what was actually being measured (one talked about alpha waves and another just said a blank mind is better). Another example, the drum on the roof. It appears that you complete the circuit with your hands with the drum beat corresponding to your heart rate. 

I would recommend a hat for the roof as it is very sunny there, as well as, snacks (no cafe or snack bar). Check out the movie schedule on the second floor at or near the beginning of your visit if think you want to watch. We tried to go towards the end of our visit and didn't know where it was located, then got there when the auditorium was full. We left without watching the movie because we didn't want to wait.

Only weird thing is they didn't have ranch dip.  But they told me to go 2 places over to a pita place and they would give me some ranch.  So while they are making my burger I went over and got the ranch and came back.  

What makes guys burgers so great is they make your burger for you fresh right when you order,  no heat lamp food waiting around all day.  You order they say 7 1/2 minutes and it will be ready and it was. The burger was great I got the cheeseburger with a large fries.  Large fries was a little over kill.

7lwe7n-Yc-V9E_HfLAeylg,Pub & Kitchen,Philadelphia,PA,5,"I can't even think of giving this place less than five stars. As I am terribly sad that my favorite restaurant is all the way in Philly. 
Came here for my second time last nite, on a trip to see a good friend and celebrate her engagement. I couldn't exactly remember what I had on the previous visit, but I knew that it ended in an orgasmic banana bread bread pudding... I mean come on, delicious. 

So, I knew I would be back.

This visit included: A wait of one hour (actually only 45 minutes or so) on a Saturday night around 8 pm. We got drinks at the bar, luckily snagging some stools in the packed area. You know if everyone around you is also choosing to wait the hour... it is that good. 
After a few glasses of wine, and a cosmo for me, we were led upstairs to a nice and much quieter dining room. 

I ordered a chicken skewer appetizer ($8) and my friend ordered a beautiful and delicate looking wedge salad ($9). My chicken skewer was very flavorful, and she loved her salad. 

Main courses: She ordered a lamb course ($22), which she raved about, but I wasn't brave enough to try. I got the pulled pork sandwich ($12), which was very good... slightly spicy for me- but I am a spice baby. It came with a simple side salad that I couldn't stop eating. And I ordered a side of mac and cheese with pork belly ($9). In hindsight, I wish I had ordered two or three mac and cheeses and called it a day.... it was so amazing!! 

And then as full as I was, I had to hear about the desserts. Which ended with a chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce for me, and a passion fruit panna cotta for my friend. I believe they were each $8. I fortunately and unfortunately ate all of mine!! ha. I was extremely full.... but it was sooo worth it. 

As far as the service goes, I found all the waitresses and hosts very kind and helpful. They seemed to sincerely care if you had a good evening... and that is always appreciated.

We decided to try out a few of their menu items. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not to sure why but I never thought the food would be that great, maybe because of the size of Cask and Ale or maybe I just viewed it as a cocktail bar. Needless their food is really good. 

We ordered the truffle mac and cheese, who doesn't love truffle mac and cheese, also the chicken Flatbread and pork belly sliders. I'm not sure which item I liked the best, my two friends said the pork sliders but honestly I liked everything. The pork belly sliders had great flavor and a nice kick with the jalapeño , the mac. Cheese of course had the right amount of truffle flavor and a nice cheese sauce with a great topping that added a lovely  texture. The flat bread was also good, crisp, a lot of chicken and lots of flavor.

On a rainy night, the valet service and coat check was greatly appreciated. We were a little early for our reservation but were immediately greeted and seated. As one of the staff filled our water glasses, he greeted those in our party having a birthday. Again as our waiter, Megan, first came to our table, she also identified our birthday companions. A very classy touch from both Moto employees. 
We began with two very good martinis. Then the burrata with beets and a pistachio pesto and an order of mussels with fennel and garbanzo beans in a lemon flavored sauce. The mussels were the best we have had in years. The accompanying bread was first rate, as well. Looking across the table, the burrata was gone. 
Next we ordered three pastas- the pappardelle, the gnochetti and the pomodoro-and the pork chop. We accompanied with brussel sprouts and the al forno potatoes.  
The chop was a beautiful plate, perfectly cooked. My pappardelle went quickly, as did the pomodoro. The gnochetti with gorgonzola and truffle oil
was tasty but too rich for my wife to complete. Both the brussel sprouts and potatoes were great versions of themselves. Our wines-the Primitivo, the Nero d'Avola and a Coppola cabernet-were all excellent. We finished with a Lemon Budino and a Chocolate Mousse Cake.

Offered to groups of 8 or larger, this fixed-price-per-person option brings out a plethora of dishes that can be highly customized to the needs/wants of the group (vegetarians, food allergies, spice preferences, etc).  Rather than deliberating between an order of noodles and entree, you can have both (and probably 6-8 other dishes besides). And don't be wary about the sharing component as the portions are large. The wait staff even kindly packaged up the portions left on the lazy Susan before the next round began. As always, they give a quick and obviously rehearsed description of the dish (cheesy but appreciated nonetheless) when they bring it to your table.

kqAa2CtPGA-QsZhhbzpzUQ,Blu Fig,Nashville,TN,5,"I have dined in at Blu Fig twice and carried out twice. Each time, the experience has been outstanding. Let me lay out a typical visit for you...

When you enter the restaurant, you'll be greeted by an enthusiastic and energetic staff. If you want to dine in, you'll be motioned to a table. Go up to the counter for carry out. You'll be presented with a menu full of Mediterranean treats: gyros, falafel, and hummus are just a few items. They also have delectable drinks: fruit smoothies, bubble tea, and their special fruit tea. I can attest to the bubble and fruit teas, which are made with fresh ingredients while you wait.

The food might take a while to get out to you; keep in mind, this isn't really ""fast food."" Your meal is made AFTER you order it, so you know the food is fresh and hot. When your food is ready, a staff member will bring it out to you or get everything packed up nice and neat so you're ready to go. They'll check on you throughout your time there, making sure you are satisfied and have everything you need.

Every item I've had at Blu Fig has been delicious. Here's a list of what I've tried:
* Hummus with Pita Bread: The best restaurant hummus I've ever had. Seriously. It's extremely smooth and flavorful, served with a drizzle of olive oil and a couple of black olives in the center. 
* Gyro meat and chicken (in pita and as a platter): Very tender and tasty. The meats are pulled from a rotating vertical spit and sliced thin. In a gyro, the meat is placed on a bed of lettuce and tomatoes, topped with a tzatziki sauce. As a platter, it is served over saffron rice pilaf with side of pita bread and seasoned chips (extra thick and crispy!) or a salad. 
* Falafel (in pita and as a platter): Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I have had falafel elsewhere (in Chicago) that is softer than Blu Fig's on the inside, which I prefer, but Blu Fig's falafel has a good texture--not dry and not cakey. Their falafel isn't greasy either, so it seems healthier than some others. 

I would still like to try Blu Fig's baklava and other favors of bubble tea (I've only had the mango so far). Honestly, I would stop by here every couple of weeks if I had a chance--the food and the friendly atmosphere entice me to keep coming back.

If there are no parking spots, that should be the first indication that inside is cramped AF and OVERFLOWING with people. If there is a line outside extending so far back that you could see it as you approach the entrance, I'm sorry but no. To validate what you will probably be thinking, no, it won't be worth it. There were no lockers upon entry which is understandable, but either make enough lockers so that it could accommodate the maximum capacity, or SET a maximum capacity, and when you REACH that capacity, inform visitors that tickets are sold out, or that they can hang at the arcade until people leave, at which point that line may enter. I honestly think that they just sell tickets until there are no more people to sell it to, and you'd agree if you were here right now. People are looking for seats. The pools are tremendously overcrowded. There are teenagers running around everywhere bumping up against people, and not enough lifeguards to maintain them. The toddlers area is way too small (and that's right, crowded), and there aren't enough accommodations for them when its jam-packed like this. 

Maybe I'll come back during the colder season, but I'll definitely have to make sure I plan it so that we arrive when the doors open so that we get a spot for the car, a locker, and enough time for the baby to get some rides in.

Everything I've had has been good but showstoppers like the Roasted Ozark Forest Mushroom Salad, the Farmhaus Butcher's Plate and Porchetta Bao cannot be missed. Recently they had a lemon tart with toasted marshmallow and pistachio crumble that was divine, best dessert I've eaten in St. Louis. Only downer for me is the post dinner coffee. They haven't offered espresso when I've been there and their drip is average at best.

Still, overall this is as good a meal as you'll eat in St. Louis and for a bit cheaper than the other high end offerings in the city.",2015-05-31,POSITIVE,0.9991114735603333

LEjVZUi2th79XWpW-gHmYA,Venzo's Pizza,Tucson,AZ,3,"Well, since it was right next to Scoot Over, I had to give it a try. and Venzo's delivered BIG TIME at lunch.

The lunch special, offered between 11 and 3 (but at any time to students and military personnel) was a fantastic value serving up a ridiculously huge amount of food. For two bones you get a huge, New York slice of cheese and a soda, for three bones, it's two slices and a soda. For better or worse, I went in for the two slices because it was so inexpensive, and put away both of them. Lesson learned: one would have been MORE than enough, and I've got a huge appetite.

The crust was nice and thin--truly New York style. I had hoped for a bit more spice in the sauce, but it was still solidly good, not too sweet. Again, for the ""dough"" you've invested, the value can't be beat.

As for the ambience, well...don't go for the ambience. It's a no-frills, eat-your-slice-and-be-on-your-way joint, just like you'd expect in NYC. So if you're looking for a quick lunchtime stop that'll get you in, filled up, and out quick without hitting you in the pocket, go-go to Venzo's for a slice--New York-style. Share the two-slice lunch with a friend.",2010-07-08,POSITIVE,0.9927681684494019

ejEVU5o5F56e7XIO07xpcA,Fox & Hounds Tavern,Saint Louis,MO,3,"This is a struggle on this one. The interior is amazing it's 5 star cozy lodge feel with nice fireplace. So much potential but really fell short...here is The Good The Bad and The Ugly.

The Good- as mention the interior is amazing, makes you want to back and relax all night long. Fish and chips was solid.

The Bad- Soooo... I have never had to eat a burger with a knife and fork... why did I have to do that you may ask? (See pic) the bun was so dry it crumbled into dust as I held it and took a bite. It was brioche bun that was way dry and appeared to have an egg wash on it which just made matters worse. I will say the burger meat, with bacon and English cheddar if eaten all at the same time was great, though burger meat by itself needed season.  

The Ugly- the coleslaw straight up had turned, it smelled like rotting vegetables in fishy water and tasted the same. I literally spit it out it was that bad.

I am sadly seeing a food quality issue here, borderline need health inspectors to visit on that coleslaw.

Also side note if they had more local craft beers other then 2-3 on draft, an extensive bourbon list this would make a killer spot for drinks and drinks only until food quality is resolved. Wishful thinking as well but would be great if this was a cigar bar as the atmosphere is prime for that.

PS- other people bitched about pricing but we felt it was very inexpensive. $51 for 2 meals, 3 drinks.

Other who ordered the burger thought it was ok, but not fantastic and also a bit rich.  (you may be tempted to judge us unsophisticated for ordering burgers at a Besh restaurant, but most of us have pretty developed palates and just crave a burger sometimes).

lk9IwjZXqUMqqOhM774DtQ,Caviar & Bananas,Nashville,TN,3,"I was invited for the soft opening for the restaurant over the weekend, so that needs to be taken into great consideration for this review.

The space: beautiful, clean, bright....very Dean & Deluca'esque. Everything is order at the counter(s) - salad bar, sandwich & soup bar, prepared foods bar and then an open air market throughout.
The prices: it's not cheap ($10+ for brunch entrees, mimosa carafe $22)
The service: Not fair to comment, since it was the soft opening...it was exactly where it should've been for a soft opening.
The food: errrrr, I had the B.E.L.T. and my counterpart had the chicken and waffle biscuit. I felt like I wanted more to mine (more egg? more arugula? more balance?) the best part was the toasted sourdough. The biscuit...It's huge - as in, big gulp huge. I regret saying, it was a bit dry and seemed to be more on display and less tasty, but I digress, how do you eat something that big anyways.

Grits were delish, but lacked any jalapeño spice and the potatoes were actually very good, crispy and all.
Another friend had flattering things to say about the breakfast burrito as well. It was all....good.

Also, to be clear, this was a soft opening, so I think there are always things to iron out, however, this is not their first rodeo. I don't think I would personally return (I'm cheap), however, the space itself is worth a look and if you need a brunch place in this area for parents or out-of-towners it is dressed to impress, I have no doubt they'll do well.

sQPNcVLTkI0s6mpNiBEVdg,Knockouts Bar and Hookah Lounge,Reno,NV,5,"Knockouts opened on Super Bowl Sunday and I have been there twice so far to taste the fare. The decor is that of a boxing ring/gym. It is very clean with a fair bit of room. It is surrounded by a dozen or more TVs for watching multiple games playing at the same time. Their food is focused on standard bar/pub fare with an emphasis on burgers and fried foods. There is a second lounge area that is still under construction. They intend to have Karaoke there twice a week and possibly a cigar bar. The new lounge has a more upscale feel to it and an impressive bar area.

On the first visit I ordered the BBQ Burger (I forgotten the name it is under on the menu). It is a 1/3 pound burger patty served with onion rings, BBQ sauce and I believe lettuce and tomato. The burger stands pretty tall, too tall for a human being to eat it. However, removing some of the stacked onion rings brought the height down to a useful level. The flavor was good and despite the heft and wetness of a BBQ burger, the bun stood up to the task and did not fall apart. I had a side of onion rings and they were excellent.

My second visit was today and I only ordered an appetizer for lunch: the stuffed, deep-fried mushrooms. The site of the mushroom heads was about 2"" across and each mushroom had been cut in half before they were deep fried. I think this diminished the whole ""stuffed"" aspect of the mushrooms as there didn't seem to be much stuffing in evidence. The flavor of the mushrooms was excellent, as was the texture of the mushroom flesh, very firm and moist.

They do have a pool table, 1 or 2 darts machines and the ubiquitous Touch Tunes music system. The staff is very friendly and I found the service to be prompt. The food took a little time to get out, but I suspect that is simply because the place is new and they are still ironing out the kinks.

I'm giving this 5 stars for a sports bar. I can't think of anything I'd change in the place. I'll update the review once the new lounge opens and I have a chance to put the bartender through his/her paces with some classic cocktails!",2016-02-11,POSITIVE,0.989926815032959

vDiD0bskBRmJMawAK2YWNg,The Liacouras Center,Philadelphia,PA,5,"Just went to a Temple bball there on a Saturday. I have been to many events at this venue but I thought that I would add a more recent review. The area is coming along nicely with lots of new stores and venues. Next door at McGonigle Hall there is now a Cosi coffee shop. Also the Liacouras Center has really stepped up it's beer selection. Most college games don't offer beer. Alcohol sales stop after half time which is ok with me. The food is not cheap but it never is at any top level venue.
The Liacouras Center is setup more like a pro arena with luxury boxes and other offerings. The arena seats 10k which is about right. 
Parking is available at the attached garage but I generally like to get there early and find and on street spot. Make sure you read the parking signs carefully because Philly likes to write tickets. 
I advise trying to get a lower level seat if you can. There are two nice pubs on Cecil B. Moore ave if you want to hangout after the game...",2014-02-10,POSITIVE,0.9986695051193237

The pita triangles that came with it were fresh and soft. We also tried the dolmades that were bigger than I've had, but tasted delicious and lemony. We also tried the garlic lemon chicken with pine nuts. Also fabulous. As was the sauteed mushrooms. So needless to say, by the time our chicken wraps came, we were full. We didn't finish because we wanted to try the walnut Baklava; that we split. I do believe that is heaven's signature dish. Three perfectly sized baklava triangles laid on creamy scoops of vanilla ice cream. It was flaky and with just the right amount of sweetness.

At Elevation Burger, the answers are yes, yes, yes, and awesome!

I usually get the cheeseburger with mayo, tomato, and lettuce. The burger is thick and fits the bun well, unlike places like In-n-Out on the west coast where the bun gets a little lost and has a slightly sweet taste. Elevation burgers are as good as Five Guys burgers, and I think the fries are better too, since I love the thinner cut and the inclusion of many crispy ""skin fries,"" which is what I call those little french fries that came from the edge of the potato, where they are more skin and less potato.

I think they had just opened when we got stationed here, and this was the first restaurant we went to, on our first night here before we had the kitchen unpacked. We love it! Their selection of sushi is expansive without being overwheming, and they have a good selection of Japanese dishes for those not fond of sushi. The first night we went I had the udon soup which was as delicious as it was massive, I took half of it home for the next day's lunch! My husband had the beef teriyaki bento box, and it was very good, as was the clear soup and salad it came with. I can't remember everything else we had, as that was a few months ago, but we sampled quite a bit of the various sushi offerings and they were all delicious! I love flying fish roe, and theirs was extremely fresh and fabulous! We also had a raw tuna salad that was absolutely amazing! Our waitress was very sweet and brought out a fork and training chopsticks for our 3 year old. 

We went again last night for my birthday dinner and, again, everything was fabulous! We started out with the gyoza, which was perfectly crisp on the bottom and tender throughout, and the dipping sauce was wonderful, I made sure to save it for my sashimi. I had the Chirasi bento box meal, with two to three pieces each of 7 different sashimi pieces, including octopus (This was a first for me, I love it!), salmon, tuna, and crab stick with seasoned rice topped with roe. I am not honestly certain what the other two were, they were white fleshed fish, I think one may have been swordfish. I'm not good at guessing unless they have a distinct appearance. The presentation was gorgeous with some of the fish rolled into rose shapes. Lovely. The dippind sauce from the goyoza was fab on the white fish, too! We also ordered the shrimp and avocado rolls, which were delish, and my husband had the beef teriyaki again, which was just as great as before! We both had the miso soup this time and it was very good! I wanted to get some red bean ice cream, as that is a favorite of mine, but our son was getting antsy, so we headed home. 

I must also add that they offer a military discount, which is always appreciated! We would definitely be here more often if we ate out of the house more (I just love to cook!), and will definitely keep coming back! My only complaint is that they don't carry Orion beer, which is one my husband drank a lot of while stationed in Japan, and he says is also very popular there. I also wish I didn't have to ask for a fork, as I am slightly chop stick handicapped, and it's a rather embarassing thing to have to ask for, so I wish they would be offered at the table along with the chopsticks. However, that is quickly remedied by asking for a fork for my son, hiding it, pretending it fell on the ground, and asking for another! ;)",2012-03-04,POSITIVE,0.9997497200965881

i also had the pleasure of trying the skyscraper: cookies and cream, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream layered with caramel, hot fudge, and crushed oreo cookies. served with whipped cream and a cherry on top. its name comes from the fact that it's creole creamery's tallest creation..and, i'd argue, probably one of the most delicious.",2010-03-21,POSITIVE,0.9995508790016174

EMzQIuFn8XWVgYbuoR4JDA,Garbonzo's Pizza,Meridian,ID,2,"Good pizza/Bad service
I'm new in town and decided to order some pizza for delivery while we unpack. 
Not knowing where to get the best slice around, I turned to Yelp to read reviews. 
Common theme with this place was while the pizza was good, the service was not so good. 
Took a shot and right out of the gate experienced the poor customer service. 
With my pizza I ordered something called ""monkey bread"". The menu online only lists one kind of ""monkey bread""-garlic and parmesan. 
When the food arrives I open the ""monkey bread"" and find bread knots with cinnamon and frosting......
So I call back thinking I had mistakenly gotten something from another customer's order. 
Turns out there are two types of ""monkey bread"" and I ended up with something I didn't want. 
They offered to give us a free ""monkey bread"" the next time we ordered from them or would give us one now if WE DROVE THERE to pick it up!!!!!
Are you kidding??! I've got hot pizza that you just delivered and I'm supposed to let it get cold driving to your restaurant to fix something you screwed up???!!!
How in the world could we have known there was another kind of ""monkey bread"" if it's not listed on the menu??!!! 
It was their responsibility to clarify when they took the order. 
Not sure if the owner reads or cares about the reviews online.....
Doesn't seem that way.....
It's a shame because the pizza was pretty good. 
Had they just said ""we'll make this right and bring you the garlic and parmesan in a few"" they would've had a new long-time customer (and we have three kids so pizza is a staple in our home!). 
Instead I'll be ordering from the competition next time.

Until this year the IMA had free admission, $5.00 parking and an excellent cafe. It still has a lovely encyclopedic collection of art from Neolithic times up to the mid 20th century, in the mid-western American art museum style. Lots of marble, excellent 19th century pieces including all the stars, Van Gogh, Monet, Renoir etc. and a noteworthy collection of early 20th century American art featuring memorable works by Georgia O'keefe and Edward Hopper, among others. The grounds are attractive with nice gardens and an excellent cafe, which we always ate at to support the museum. This year things changed. I gave IMA three dollar signs because their new entrance fee of $18.00 per person makes this one of the most expensive, and therefore inaccessible, art museums in the country. The operation of the cafe has been outsourced to a catering company, adding the costs of a profit hungry middle-man to both the museum and the patron. When the museum was free we paid a small fee to see an astonishing exhibition of Ai Weiwei's art, fresh from the Smithsonian and on its way to Los Angeles which I will always remember. Now you must pay more than it costs to visit the LACMA in CA  and only slightly more than the Met to see a solid permanent collection (Cincinnati [Free], Cleveland [Free] and Detroit [$12.50] are better, Toledo [Free] is equal) featuring special exhibitions one might expect to find in the Evansville town hall.

It's hard to not run to the door when it hits you. We went a couple weeks back for a laid-back dinner-for-two.

We started with a dozen char-grilled oysters. Chef Scott has this dish down, with just the right amount of butter and cheese on the oysters, along with tasty french bread slices for dippin'.

Softshells were running good that visit, so I had the special: softshell crab over fettucini pasta, topped with a creamy crawfish sauce. It's one of those wicked-overkill dishes that you just can't pass up. Eat the crab, nibble at the pasta, bring the rest home for a great pasta leftover if you don't want to overindulge.

My wife did the build-your-own pasta--Chef Scott's comments on why this is on his menu inspired a separate blog post I'll do later this week. She got rigatoni with chicken in a creamy alfredo sauce. The chicken was grilled nicely and the sauce subtely seasoned for a good match.

We usually let Chef surprise us for dessert, and he rarely steers us wrong. This time it was ""Red Velvet Elvis"" cake...deadly!

First this place has an active bar with multiple TVs.  This is great for Happy Hour but not so great if you are seated near it with the intention of having a peaceful meal.  So Rule #1 is to ask to be seated away from the bar.  I've never found this to be a problem as the staff is very accommodating.

Second, in my opinion, the adult libations are generally a dollar or two too high for a mid-level Italian place.  It's very easy to order drinks here that go over $10.  So consider yourself forewarned.

So let's talk about all the positive attributes-

The location is fabulous.  It's within walking distance of Olde City, the Walnut Street Theater, the Historic District, etc., etc.  

The have a few outside tables and Chestnut Street is great for people watching.

These folks have one of the best free parking arrangements in all of Philadelphia.  That's right, I said free and the parking lot is in the same building.  If you are driving in it doesn't get any better than this. Note that free parking is available after 3 PM.  

They use OpenTable so making your reservation is super convenient.  By the way, these folks do a great job during Restaurant Weeks. Make yourself a note to book early for those coveted RW seatings.

Regarding the food; expect classic Italian in large portions.  It doesn't matter if you are a carnivore, like your protein from the sea, or are of the vegetarian persuasion.  Everybody will be happy here.  Expect appetizers to be about $10 and entrées to range from the high teens to mid-twenties. 

The Broccoli Rabe appetizer ($10) is to die for.  It comes with sweet Italian sausage and grilled polenta.  The lovely wife has tried the Chicken Alla Roma ($21) and pronounced it excellent.  It comes with mushrooms and asparagus in a lemon-caper sauce.

If you are in this part of town, give them a try for lunch.  I'll bet you come back for dinner.",2012-03-30,NEGATIVE,0.8661039471626282
MMRRS6YhVRx_iN5-JhMRYg,Han Dynasty,Philadelphia,PA,1,"This review has more to do with the experience rather than with the food. I am writing this review even before I head to the restaurant for dinner tonight and believe me when I say this, that I would never end up eating here if the majority of the birthday girl's party did not insist on eating at Han Dynasty just because she likes the food. 


It takes 2 phone calls and talking to 3 people to get a reservation at this restaurant, that itself is a turn off. The first lady I speak to is flat out rude when I call asking to make a dinner reservation for tonight ""We're all booked for tonight and not giving out any reservations"" she says before hanging up on me. I call back and a second lady answers and I say I need a reservation for 15 people at 9:30 and she asks for how long? WTF??? ""For however long it takes 15 adults to get done with dinner that's how long"" She responds saying they close at 10PM and the lady has no clue what day it is and they are open later on Friday's and finally agrees to give me a reservation. 


It is absolutely appalling when people working in the hospitality industry are rude. If you can't be courteous to your guests consider a different profession. I understand you are in the university city area and have to, more often that you like, deal with students but that by no means is an excuse for ill-treating your guests.

We called on a Saturday night, and although they don't take reservations, they had a table for 4 available so we rushed over. I see some Yelpers complaining in reviews about the service here, but that was definitely not our experience. Our server was completely  attentive throughout the meal - and had an excellent sense of humor, something that's too often at a shortage - and there was no delay in the food being prepared and served. The Pulled Pork (seitan) sandwich was very good, a definite comfort food item, and I think their sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. The side of brussel sprouts for the table was a good idea. (I'm indifferent to the bacon-flavored tempeh, which substitutes for the bacon on the vegetarian and vegan versions of the bacon menu items - one side of the menu is for carnivores, the other side offers vegetarian versions of basically the same items). The draft beer list was outstanding the night we were there, although one listed stout had kicked.

We arrived to Biscuit Love at 8:30am on a Saturday. To our pleasant surprise, there was zero wait! That alone earns you a star, Biscuit Love! In addition, the self-serve sparkling and still water machine is a nice touch.

I ordered the Princess with an egg on top. Trust me, hot chicken and eggs for breakfast is a gorgeous & delicious thing! I devoured the entire meal in very short order. 

The only problem I could find was the coffee. It tasted burnt and left something to be desired. Then again, if you are going to Biscuit Love for its coffee, you're doing it all wrong!

We walk in and there's absolutely no business, its prime time for lunch.  Some of us order the ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT sushi - which can decently fill you up.  However for those who ordered A LA CARTE, the prices of our food came up to near the same price.  If you have no choice, stick to the ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT cuz at least it'll fill you up and you get a variety of sushi rolls.

I ordered the Beef Teriyaki and California Roll.  

Beef Teriyaki - beef was either frozen/old + overcooked, super dry, not made for humans to consume.

California Roll - the imitation crab was the stick you buy at the frozen aisle, this was literally something i can make myself .

What came out was a poorly reheated 4""X6"" square of a layer of macaroni topped with ground beef, 1"" of browned mashed potatoes.
What you don't see mashed potatoes in the description of the dish? You thought that the word ""layers"" meant more than one?  You thought that béchamel was a sauce?  You thought Parmesan cheese usually could be seen or when melted looked like it had been grated rather than an overdone mashed potato.

When I asked the waiter, he said that those were not mashed potatoes, it was solid béchamel, that they no longer put a liquid sauce on the dish.  I asked him why the menu said sauce and he just shrugged his shoulders.   Several minutes later the manager came by, offered the same lame story and offered to bring me something else.  When asked about the potatoes, just looked at me as if to say, you should have known Pastichio has potatoes.

By this time, I was and am pissed off that I was told twice I should have guessed about the mashed potatoes, and that béchamel was not a sauce.

-The location. I'd live here if I had a million dollars and could invest in Bayou St. John
-The outdoor seating! Is there a better way to spend a beautiful New Orleans Day? 
-Bike parking for DAYS. Clientele can be a little hipstery, so this is great.
-Upstairs meeting space. I often meet with community groups after hours, and the staff at Fair Grinds has been fantastic with some of my annoying last minute requests to use the meeting room. Thanks guys, you make our work easier!
-Savory food options- I can't always do sweet stuff, and they've always got some interesting savory scones or sandwiches. 
-Great decor/vibe. Very comfortable, and what a hotel staffer recently described to me as ""New Orleans Bohemian."" I'll just leave that phrase there for you. Do with it what you will.
-Outlets, outlets, outlets. Need to plug in your laptop because it's 10 years old and the battery is crap? Good, so does everyone else. Luckily there's outlets for everyone, so charge away!
-Outdoor seating is dog friendly.

Some things that could be a little better:
-Sometimes the wifi isn't quite strong enough for everyone and you'll get booted.
-It can be a little crowded and hard to find a seat. (This is a good thing too! I'm glad they're doing well, and if making a new friend is the worst thing to happen to me I'll live)",2015-01-06,POSITIVE,0.9986680746078491

It was unbelievable! The brat flavor is something you really can't mess up too much, and this was not at all, especially on that awesome bun! We all had the asparagus as a side, which was delicious. I had a pumpkin beer, which is something I would probably actually die for. That good. Get one if you haven't had one. Preferably on tap.

There were people everywhere, Mom's on the phone with their children picking out Disney Princess costumes, Sorority girls getting their handcuffs or nurse hats, and employees dressed up as creepy clowns pointing us in the wrong direction when looking for temporary tattoos. 
Two of my pack had to actually leave the store because listening to the Cha-Cha slide while bumping into people was just too much to deal with.

One of my favorite things about places in the city is to go where my elders go. Those places are almost guaranteed to be friendly and legit. While I also consider Nellie Glenn's a cool spot for my south side turf, I'm also now adding The Haven to that list.

M0c99tzIJPIbrY_RAO7KSQ,Hyatt Regency St. Louis at the Arch,Saint Louis,MO,5,"Some people may say I am biased with my opinions on Hyatt since I am loyal to Hyatt properties. However, I think I am more critical in the end after staying at many different properties all over. That being said I have had bad stays and good stay, this being one of the top 10. I booked the Hyatt regency on a cross country road trip because I wanted to be comfortable and was pretty sure it would deliver.

Driving up to the hotel I was greeted by valet, the young man was very friendly and offered to get assistance with my bags. I didn't need it since I was leaving most in the car, but it was very nice to have the option. My car was wicked away and I entered the hotel. 

The lobby is very nice and a lot is going on here! People going to dinner at Ruth's Chris or the Red Table Kitchen, music being played, and people gathering at the bar. Overall it is very lively and refreshing compared to other hotels I have stayed at. I walked over to the front desk to check in and was greeted by a friendly and very helpful employee. She gave me the room I asked for and I had no need to come back and change rooms! (I usually have to change at least once) She directed me to the elevators and I was off to my room.

The room was a junior suite with an arch view. It was huge for a junior suite and the view was lovely (even with the construction). A separate living area and sleeping area was nice. Cleanliness wasn't even a question here, everything was clean and almost new! The bathroom was a normal sized bathroom but with an amazing walk in shower! 

Room service was from the red kitchen restaurant downstairs and you can check out my review on the food on their yelp page. Service was quick and everyone I encountered was very polite. 

In the morning I went downstairs to the gym for a good run. Usually hotel gyms are disappointing, but this one was great! A decent amount of equipment (for a hotel) plus a choice between a regular towel AND a chilled towel. The space was clean, bright, and airy.

Checkout was seamless, my car was called for and I settled my bill. After getting my receipts I went to my car which was waiting for me at the valet station.

I was a bit skeptical about this stay before getting there since I was in the midwest and didn't know if it would be up to my east coast standards. This hotel exceeded them and I had an exceptional stay! If I ever get back to St. Louis I will be staying here again.",2016-11-12,POSITIVE,0.9607274532318115

But, make no mistake Ghini's is the real deal. We have been here for breakfast and lunch several times a month. We have yet to try their Fri dinner, but that is on our bucket list. 

There can be a bit of a wait on the weekends for breakfast, but they have a nice set up of water, etc., while you wait. The servers are attentive to getting your name on the list promptly. The food is well worth the wait - it is always fresh and cooked to order. We have never been disappointed. I love the Florentine omelet and my husband loves the eggs Provençale. We also enjoy the Croque Monsieur. I find most of Ghini's fare to be light, fresh, and healthy, which is what we prefer over heavy, carb laden monstrosities - but that is just us. My son loves the French toast and heavier omelets. 

They are a pet friendly place allowing dogs on the patio (leashed), which we find endearing. There is also a bakery right next door - not sure if they are affiliated/partners - or separate - but we enjoy eating our breakfast and then grabbing some baked goods to take home.

SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,Santa Barbara,CA,5,"My favorite place to get shellfish (besides fresh off the pier on Saturday mornings). It is not just a tourist trap, even though you can find it at the end of the SB pier past all the other tourists traps. Love to get the rock crab deal ($25 for a 2-3lb rock crab with onion rings) 

My favorite moment:

I will never forget the day we tried their California King crab for the first time. It was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking/ S.U.P. (With paddle sports from the Harbor area) and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co. While on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier. After our hour on the ocean, we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular. Luckily since it was early (before 5pm dinner rush) we were seated quickly. The server recommended the cali kings, said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh. We looked over and there they were! Being dumped into the tanks. They were kicking and trying to climb out. 

Priced at $17.95 per lb, they came anywhere between 1.5 to 3 lbs. I went for a 2pounder. That first succulent bite was heaven. And I mean, damn that is one buttery heaven. Each morsel was so large, so sweet..all of my girls and I were silent, with glistening eyeballs staring at each other. 

After that day, I couldn't get that crab out of my mind. Any chance I could I wanted to go back before the season was over.

But be careful, a 3 pounder means you're eating a $75 crab. Only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad. For that price..I should've gotten both. It's okay, just add a $1 and you can both i guess. 

Besides the crab, the oysters are always good and I highly recommend the uni appetizer. 

Okay I really recommend the uni appetizer. I usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home, but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu. It's so fresh and clean, that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wiggling.",2017-04-20,POSITIVE,0.9952805638313293

I have the dish ranked as good as any mac and cheese I have tried. It is in a tie with Beechers (locations in New York and Seattle). The pork belly and ""Banh mi"" Gulf Fish Tacos are excellent. The lamb sliders and sweet potato gnocchi with Louisiana crab are very good too.

Of course, Three Muses also has live jazz performances. The music is fantastic. I arrived at the gastropub ten minutes before it opened so I could get a seat at the bar immediately. It was a Sunday night and it still got busy for dinner in a hurry.

mpVZG520RL-K1YeQi55ZPg,The Blarney Stone,Philadelphia,PA,4,"One of my favorite bars on campus, simply for how comfy and defining of my college experience it is. I only regularly come here for Tuesday night quizzo, which is probably why I'm rating it so high since I wouldn't know about the super crowded weekend nights-- not too crowded, but lively at the same time to have a great time with your friends while also being able to hold a conversation. Great late night deals on food (I recommend the onion rings, although you can't go wrong with any other of the fried, greasy, drunk food) and good selection of beers, although I'm not a huge beer person.

BUT, the service was not so good. The server wouldn't write down our order (maybe they are required to memorize orders) and kept coming back to confirm/repeat the order. Obviously, not required to memorize orders unless Thursday was her last night of employment, but I doubt it.

If she checked on us, she failed to make it apparent. The bartender was worse. The top shelf margarita was so tart it was unbearable to drink. Making matters worse, he screwed up my vodka tonic. Two ingredients, people...I don't know how this was possible. We didn't receive any water and our server seemed to have more tables outside as she was never in sight. That's the only reason we drank as much as we did of those poorly made $10 drinks. Less than half was consumed and she never noticed.

Seats were stolen, bitchy looks were exchanged, and it was just not pretty.  

Once I made it to the back, only slightly worse for the wear, I received adequate service.

On the other hand the other two components and look for, the food, and service, are both pretty good.

Let's start with the food.  It is pretty typical Taiwanese food, but it was done very well. Liked all the dishes that we had, suggest the beef pancake, that is usually a good measure for any Taiwanese restaurant. The ones here are pretty good, although I would say the portions are a little smaller than usual, it was still very well done.

What I would say differentiate this place from other Chinese restaurant is the service. I honestly expected to be ignored once we got seated, this is usually the norm for typical Chinese restaurant until you flag someone down. However, in this case the servers came around fairly frequently and water checking on how things are going.

After my last experience, I thought I'd give them another chance since they are closest to where I live, so it is more convenient.  

Took my van in for oil change.  The van also had vibrations at high speeds.  They said tires need rotation and balance, gave estimated time of 1 hour for the whole thing.

It took them an hour to come back and tell me that two of the tires need changing, and that it will take another 1 - 1.5 hours.  (Why couldn't they tell me that as soon as they started on the tires?)

These are the run-flat tires that only Honda can change.  So, cursing the day I decided to buy an Odyssey, I agree to shell out about $800 additional.  Another hour later they told me that it needs some kind of a ring, another $150.

Well, 4 hours and more $1,000 later, I drove off -- the vibrations were still there!  They told me that the mechanic had taken it for a test drive after fixing it, but clearly either someone was lying or they are just nincompoops.

Immediately took it back,  and this is when their genius really impressed me -- without taking another look, or even taking it for a test drive, they said that I need a new axle which would normally be $840, but they will give me a 25% discount (because they are so magnanimous I suppose).

Finally I left and on the way back home, the engine light came on!  Called them and of course, they asked me to bring it back so they can take a look.

Have others had similar experiences with them?  Is this systematic?

If anyone at Honda (not a dealer/service person) is reading this:  what does ""Honda Certified"" mean?  All the people in the service department were Honda Certified.  Does it mean that you are capable of getting out of bed, putting on clothes and coming to work?

1) st. louis ribs were NOT burned, at all.  Looked fine, except lacking flavor AND very tough & chewy.  They were fresh for sure, just not good ribs. period.

2)  Got 25. They were MOSTLY dry and overcooked/charred.  Girl took them back and got us fresh ones from the kitchen.  she happily agreed they were dry/overdone.  said the cook agreed.

2nd batch looked awesome - moist, shiny, hot... except the only flavor they had was from what had to be some kind of baste they brush on when these are on the grill.   was just an oily taste... mixed with grill char & grit.  
They looked so different, i told the owner ""its an insult"" that you served us that first batch of wings. 

cudos for bringing out more wings - they ain't cheap - but these aren't worth eating either.

YOU COULD HAVE OFFERED ME ALL YOU CAN EAT RIBS & WINGS and I WOULD NOT have been satisfied at any price.  Its just a waste of a meal.

3) fries that came with ribs were great.  ordered a 2nd order ($1.49) and they were not as good.  left half.  was really odd

4) baked beans have a sauce/juice in them right?  these were the goo that comes in the bean can.  not much else added.   Open a can of Van Camp's, take a bite, and thats what these were.

OK... still here... here it comes !!!!

5) Uncle Mikes has a unique approach to doing some sides.  Most places would crack open a can of green beans and all all sorts of stuff to make them flavorful (salt, chicken base, onions, pepper, etc.).    NOPE.   Not at Mikes.  They try to REMOVE ALL FLAVOR from their green beans.   I actually tricked my wife into a bite by claiming ""awesome"", ""holy cow"", and then she spit hers out and gave me a nasty look while I laughed at her.   

Talked with two other tables who were not happy either.   
Place SHOULD do well, except that the food is bad.  
Good luck.
Wouldn't expect them to stay open much longer.",2016-02-25,POSITIVE,0.9975321292877197

uE40984_YDgVvPeRpFcCaQ,The Fat Ham,Philadelphia,PA,3,"I feel like I may be an outlier here because I was unimpressed by The Fat Ham. Since moving to Philadelphia from Atlanta, I've been missing southern food tremendously and especially good southern-style PORK dishes, so upon hearing about this place I could not wait to get there. And I'm really not so picky - I love all types of food, I'm eager to appreciate it.
 
So, the dishes really were tasty but somehow just didn't induce those ""mmms"" I expect from a great restaurant. The portions are way too small for the prices and the flavors aren't as complex as you'd hope. 

My best advice is if you're actually from the South, don't go here expecting to find the haven for damn good southern food that you've been waiting for. If you weren't raised on this kind of food, I'm guessing you'll feel a lot warmer toward the place.",2015-02-25,NEGATIVE,0.9842549562454224
GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw,Luke,New Orleans,LA,4,"Okay, so my girl friend really hated the burger, and thought the spatzle was even worse ... but I loved the pork special, the value, and the fact that they brew their own German beer!  

Food: Ordered an onion tart bacon pizza concoction to start things off.  The Emmenthaler cheese is SWEET.  And I think that's what makes the flamenküche (yeah, try pronouncing it) work, the combination of sweet and savory made my tummy happy but at $13, it was only a slightly overpriced tease compared to the amazing pork special I dived into next.  That dish is big, succulent and at $15, probably the best value of any one entree I had all week in New Orleans.  The pork is resting on top of crab and  crawfish stuffed cornbread that layers the bottom of the plate so it almost resembles a casserole, or a Thanksgiving stuffing.  In between the pork and the stuffed cornbread is a generous heaping of greens (kale? spinach?  whatever it was, it tasted great mixed with the sauce from the pork).  

The burger on the other hand ... one of the more expensive items on the menu at $16, we both were expecting more, especially after reading the newspaper clippings lining the inside of the restaurant that all raved about this one item in particular.  Sure, it was big and pretty, but the meat really lacked any distinct flavor.  It was kind of bland, and the spatzle my girl friend opted for on the side was even worse.  Our waiter was kind enough to throw in a complimentary order of pommes frites (""because they really are so good"") that were also under-seasoned but which I happily devoured anyway.  Basically, you don't go to a John Besh restaurant and order a burger anyway, right?  SO don't follow our strategy either.

Service: Our waiter was very conversational and a fellow foodie lover.  We even got to talking about great places to eat in Manhattan.  I just wish we spent more time talking about that damn spatzle because the way he described it to my girl friend was totally off.  We had never had the German staple before, so we were surprised to see what looked like macaroni salad on our table instead of the gnocchi he promised us in the totally inaccurate description.  

Atmosphere: A real classy joint that is connected to the Hilton on the border between the French Quarter and the business district.  Every plate is served on top of a wooden carving board, which kind of blends the whole upscale American and hearty German atmosphere as well. There is a full bar also, and happy hour is a must (25 cent oysters and half off drinks and beers).  It feels like a place where business people go to enjoy themselves after a long day of work, checking their briefcases at the revolving door.  I guess you could compare it to the Wall Street crowd in Manhattan, although it's STILL New Orleans we're talking about, so don't worry about it being too stuffy in there.

Value: As I mentioned earlier, I really do believe for the quality and quantity of food, Luke is a great value if you stick to the specials.  Happy Hour is one of those great specials, even if you don't like oysters (down a Sazerac or two) and for dinner, they offer 3-course specials at $23 a pop.  Not bad at all, and I heard super things about their chicken and matzah ball soup (one of the 3-course options to start).

mCo2uVTTGYrEhRrkQW-CMw,Empress Garden,Philadelphia,PA,4,"A microcosm of Chinatown itself, Empress Garden is a staple for quick, quality Chinese food. Being that standard American only reaching so far within his comfort zone, I always go for the General Tso's, which is really great at Empress. The combination dinners on the back page offer this dish and many more with your choice of soup and rice for a very reasonable price (a little under $11). The Chicken and Broccoli and Sweet & Sour Chicken both look really good. As far as Wonton soup is concerned, it's the best I've ever had. 

Down 10th street just past the Friendship Arch sits Empress Garden, in all its simple glory, its dirty windows and plastic table covers - a recent addition that I think they should do away with. I'm sure it makes cleanup easier, but those thick plastic covers are a nuisance, in the way every time you cross your legs, sticky to the touch. Just take it from me, Empress, it's better without. 

That note aside, Chinese food - as well all know - can be hit or miss. It's like Mexican restaurants that way: you'll eat it no matter what, but sometimes you raise an eyebrow as you do so. Also, it's a BYOB, which is a nice touch if you want to grab a bottle of wine or a couple beers beforehand. If you find yourself in Chinatown, find your way to Empress Garden, one of the gems of the area and maybe, just maybe, the best General Tso's I've ever tried.",2013-04-16,POSITIVE,0.9994816184043884

Read the Yelp reviews; hit or miss it seems. Menu was easy to find on the Yelp page (thank you!) and the food was exactly what we were craving. Burgers, pasta, salads. What really intrigued me and have to admit is the main reason we went, was the pic of the artichoke app on the site.  I LOVE artichokes! I really love artichokes done well and that pic won me over.
Place is very large with outdoor seating on two patios and large indoor seating. This does not include the bar area attached. We sat outside on the top patio.  Greeter was friendly, sat right away. Waitress came over right away. Friendly greeting. Mentioned it was our first time and open to suggestions. She offered a couple (don't recall them) and I shared my excitement for the artichoke app and how it was the reason for us being there.  Ordered the artichoke along with the pappardelle pasta, side of black bean soup, side of mashed potatoes. My husband wasn't super hungry so the side orders were his.  Great way to try a variety of items that all sounded soooo good!
Artichoke app arrived and it was GREAT! Garlic, onion, tomato, yes, yes, yes. Cooked perfectly. Easy to eat the meat off the leaves, leaves pulled off easy from the heart. So happy this was as good as hoped.
Black bean soup tasted ok.  Really thick which was fine but it hardened up pretty quickly and reminded us of chocolate pudding. Mashed potatoes were ok, nothing amazing but liked the skins included and not a lot of butter.  
Pappardelle pasta was very flavorful! Garlic, onion, tomato, olives. Noodles a bit al dente (sp?) which made me very happy. Love big wide noodles. Very large portion, should have shared it but good news, took half home and ate it for lunch the next day! Love pasta that holds up to being as flavorful as the next day. We will be back & try out the bar next time.

-r4K0ZM0cQ-cjLlH3S-LAA,Helzberg Diamonds,Reno,NV,4,"Great, friendly Service.  Fun, mirthful sales lady.  Would happily buy from her if I were shopping.

I went here just to check out the correct color of a supposedly blue Citizen Eco-Drive watch.  I'm fond of this watch line in part because the styles are really quite nice for many of them, but also because of their limited environmental footprint (no battery replacement) and the potential for watches that could last me the rest of my life, not to mention the convenience of not dealing with batteries of the watch stopping.

They remembered me from the phone and had the watch that I wanted to compare to one I had purchased from ebay (that had a faded watch face compared to the one that they had).  They were friendly in comparing and also pointed out some of the other cool watches from Eco-Drive in a sales pitch that didn't feel forced and bemused me a bit.  Once I get one Eco-Drive, I should get the one for gold (with the dial on the left side so it doesn't mess with my golf swing), the Sky Hawk for when I'm a pilot, the Diving watch for diving and then I can master land, sea and air.  I felt that the saleslady felt me out for my amenability to this discussion and assessed me properly.

She then was nice in removing a link from another watch that I had and gave me the link in a plastic bag at no cost.

After I left there was no pressure or discomfort, no hard feelings and I just felt good about the whole experience.

I'd definitely shop there again.

This is not not the typical Italian. Katie's unique twist to her dishes knock those restaurants out of the park!

We tried the Pear Pizza and the Fig and Squash Pizza (without pancetta). Both were delicious. The table is centered with extra olive oil and chili oil, which you can add to enhance or spice up your meal.  

Always remember with better ingredients come elevated prices.  Expect to pay a little more for these fresher, healthier dishes. 

Katie's also delivers excellent service that is knowledgeable, quick and accurate.  We were not disappointed in the service.  They seated us quickly and served us efficiently. 

What stops this place from being a five? The prices did effect my rating.  While seafood and fresh ingredients are frequently listed on the menu, I have experience fresh, larger (in portion size ) meals, that were lower in price. My own personal bias, also effected the rating. Italian is not my favorite, so it is based primarily on my personal taste.  If this review were over Italian food, it would be a five.

Still working out some kinks, but we liked the simple approach and prices were reasonable!!

Our visit to Mike's started off  well...the atmosphere is simple and focused on a cowboy theme. They seem to have removed some tables after taking over from the last restaurant, which is a welcome change - it does not feel crowded or cramped. Also - inside and half of outside is all non-smoking!!  Yay!  Our server was great and very helpful.

Food: 
We liked the corn nuggets and chilli.  The pulled pork sandwich and collards greens were also very good. Surprisingly the ribs were disappointing. Very rough and dry with not much flavor. We sent them back and were told the kitchen says that is the way they were supposed to be. After speaking to the manager (when he stopped by our table to ask how everything turned out) it seems that is NOT how the ribs are supposed to be and he encouraged us to try them another time...after he has time to speak to the kitchen.

Seems like the management/owners are truly interested in making things right. MY replacement pulled pork sandwich was great!

Music:
If you like country music and dancing, they still have it here. We did not stay, but line dancing lessons were starting at 7:30 on a Thursday and they have live bands on occasion...probably weekends.

The menu is similar to what I have experienced at PFC, and the prices are lower, so far me likey. How could I not try the lettuce wraps, I'm obsessed with them and order at almost anyplace that I encounter them. Here there are 2 versions, I opted for the Thai and it was good but not great, but kudos to them for providing enough lettuce to eat them with. Next time I'll the original version. 

A few entrees looked enticing but in keeping with a Thai-ish theme I selected Dynamite chicken. I liked this a lot, crunchy chicken pieces that were slightly spicy. The veggie pasty of the dish was sparse, mucho scallion but just some shredded carrots and red pepper. Sauce was almost non existent. Trish ordered her favorite here, chicken Pad Thai. I tasted and thought it was ok, not quite what the dish can be in a good Thai shop, but for the price and quickness, very acceptable.

They offer a good rewards program that probably helps bring back repeat customers. At our early lunch arrival we noticed that the place filled in quickly.

Very close and walking distance to the stadium as well.

They have a decent assortment of sandwiches, bagels and donuts. I can tell the bagels are made fresh, which is a plus. I was really excited to see they have lox cream cheese so I got that on an onion bagel. It was good, but nothing special. The cream cheese was not pack with flavor and I have had better bagels elsewhere in the area.

Also the donuts look good and taste average as well. I got a plain yeast which was light in sweetness and texture. Though, it kind of reminded me of the ones you can get at a grocery store.

That's fine if you are good with giving money away, but I'm just not that philanthropic when it comes to supporting a corporation.

While I understand the desire to get ""organic"" with it, Between Wolf Pack Meats, Trader Joes, Raley's and Great Basin Co-op, there aren't many items available here  that aren't available for 20-40% less somewhere else.

However, it's so relaxing to walk the broad, beautifully displayed aisles that I'm sometimes almost glad this store is the only purveyor of my favorite shampoo. It costs me about $30 to lay in an 8 month supply -- coincidentally, the same time interval between my visits to this store.

Each time, the excellent displays beckon and the gently helpful staff members rave about something new I've never tried, and I end up spending another $30 on stuff I really don't need!

I give Whole Foods credit for having the most extensive selection of teas available at any grocery store, so I've made an unscheduled trip or two just to buy tea. The catch? If you buy one of the teas that is available locally elsewhere, get ready to fork out fiftty cents to a dollar more per package to buy it here.

UUpwoAAZcJyUWOqp81_3mA,Cajun Encounters Tour Company,New Orleans,LA,5,"First and foremost you'll need to do two things. You need to book a tour with these people & you need to bring a few cans of bug spray. 

The tour was great! We started off strolling around and hearing information about the waters, animals and plants in the area. The tour guide was very informative on how Katrina changed the area as well. The first hour was uneventful and we couldn't seem to find any gators. I'll be honest - I'm not a hard to please person and just strolling around the swamp looking at nature was great for me. We were able to find gators at the last hour of our tour. Smaller and medium sized! I think it's awesome that the guides lure in the gators by throwing marshmallows and waving hotdogs on a stick. It makes it fun for the kids to watch, too. 

There was one part of the tour in which our guide had a gator on one side of the boat and a boar on the other. He made the effort to throw feed on the land for the boar to get out of the water. I love that Cajun Encounters isn't just showing customers the animals in the swamp but the company is truly protecting the animals.

The end of our tour the gnats came out. We would move away and they would follow. I didn't realize that they bite but the next day we were covered in bites and itching like crazy. We went through four tubes of itch cream and one itch spray. Our tour was on the 8th and it's now the 16th, some bites are still there. Just be smart ( unlike me! ) and use bug spray... lots of it. 

Over all, I loved this tour! Seeing gators was fun. A boar jumped right up onto the boat where I was sitting - so fun! We were able to get a ton of great photographs and felt like the tour is great for the price. After our tour, I was able to get a t-shirt for only $6. :-)",2015-04-16,POSITIVE,0.9927008152008057
rE35KDAIC_nIAhurQCaCMA,Texas Roadhouse,Avon,IN,4,"Great place for a steak in Avon!

I have eaten at Texas Roadhouse at least 15 times over a 6-year span.  I will start by saying that this is a great place to get a steak!

Steak has a marinade/seasoning that makes it taste great!  I'd recommend the Cowboy cut Sirloin for the big appetites-- a 16 oz. cut of pure steak, no bones or fat-- I ended up enjoying this more than the Ribeye or Porterhouse steak there!

Other notable food items at Texas Roadhouse-- Beanless Chili is excellent, as is anything here with barbecue sauce on it. (ribs, chicken)  All of the appetizers are good also.  The one exception is the burger, I ordered this once and received a burnt up burger that was not good at all!  Very odd considering the quality of the other food here.

Something they do not advertise much is the beer there-- the COLDEST beer I have had in the Indy Metro Area!  I once ordered a Bud Select (aluminium bottle) and I swore it had frost on it!-- yes, FROST!  This is one seriously cold beer served up here LOL!!!  Beer drinkers, this is your big tip!

The prices are very resonable too for a steakhouse-- the above mentioned 16oz steak, drink, salad and baked potato cost about $20 before tax and tip-- not gonna happen if you visit one of the downtown Indy steakhouses, that's for sure!   

Having said all of this, this place is not for everyone, as it is awfully loud and can be quite busy and raucous during dinner-- not the spot for an intimate dinner for 2 for sure!  There are a couple of vegetarian options here, but mostly the menu is directed squarely at the carnivorous appetites for sure.

Our room was done in soft yellows that I found relaxing, and the bed was huge. Another person we were at complained that the beds were bad, but I didn't have an issue with them, all though I will be bringing my own pillows next time we come. There was a tempting mini bar and snack bar in our room that I nearly had removed because I was terrified of sleep-eating a three dollar Kit Kat bar, but if my husband and I had more money I would have been super psyched about the tiny bottles of liquor and gone nuts.

The general use pool was gorgeous and I loved the fountain. There weren't too many splashers and the life guards seemed to be doing a good job. I didn't think to bring workout close so I didn't get to use the awesome fitness center, though I thought it awesome that each cardio machine at a TV on it and you got to borrow head phones. My husband and I both made several visits to the steam room in the male and female locker rooms though. I had never been in one before so after I got over my initial freak out when the steam turned out, I loved how soft it made my skin feel.

I treated myself to a pedicure at the Spa, which also allowed me access to all their little pools and sauna's and (much hotter, admittedly almost unbearably so) steam rooms and more. You got a nice soft robe (which you can purchase- alas, next time!), lockers, and free little snacks, juice and some of the most bomb ass tea I have ever had! My pedicure felt great and came out nice. It was way more than I'd normally pay, but my husband insisted he treat me since we don't get to do these things very often (awwwww). My sister in-law got a wine massage- or something like that, and said it was among the best massages she's ever received.

I went during lunch and sat at the bar. I didn't order a drink but there prices were in line with any other trendy bar. The cocktails looked fresh but not over the top. 

I ordered the whipped feta with honey and the country fried cauliflower. I probably could have stuck with just the feta as the pita are pretty big and filling but it was worth it to try the cauliflower. The cauliflower was a slightly spicy creamy on the palate dish. And the feta had a nice juxtaposition between the salty of the feta and the sweet of the honey.

They sell racks and racks of hot sauces and spices, but also have a booth-like ""restaurant"" with local, gamey food such as gator sausages and burgers. 

SERVICE- Sorry not sorry, but this is where the one star heavily comes in. Two Asians walk into N'awlins... and how does that joke finish? Oh wait, it wasn't a joke because it happened in real life. I'll tell you how it went down. A handful of other parties were served before us, so not only did we wait a long time to put our orders in, but it also took forever and a day for us to get our food! By the time we finished our food and paid, the market was literally closing and daylight was gone. 

FOOD- It was ok. Definitely a bit on the oiler side, especially the fries. I ordered the gator burger because they ran out of gator dogs (womp). I finished it all, but I think the variety of hot sauces available made it more exciting and yummy than it would have been plain. Couldn't really taste that it was gator, but the idea of it was cool, I guess.

Chicken Curry (or whatever they have as a special): potatoes and chicken and a delicious warm soup. Perfect for winter days.

CA5BOxKRDPGJgdUQ8OUOpw,Maynards,Tucson,AZ,2,"First, this review is for the market, not the dining room, and my order was to go.  My advice is that if you love this place, do not place a to go order here.  I've been eating here pretty regularly and have never tried to order take out until my most recent visit.  One of the people in the group needed to get home quickly but we had been planning on Maynard's and figured we'd stick with it.  I never considered that the market didn't do carryout and I certainly wasn't trying to be difficult. It was my mistake and I'm not trying to be a jerk about asking for a service that isn't offered, I really didn't know.  I guess the market just seemed like a carryout friendly menu.    Anyway, my issue is the way the lady behind the counter handled the situation.  
I could have handled a polite, we don't do carryout.   However, she was really rude and clearly irritated.  There was seriously no need for all of that.  She went on about how the menu isn't intended for carryout and they don't have proper take out containers.  Ok, I get that you don't do carryout.  Really, I've brought home leftovers plenty of times in what I would consider to be very proper containers so it's not necessary to make up reasons why you're annoyed that I asked for carryout. Just tell me that it's not something you offer and I'll come back next time I can dine in.  

The vibe in this place is usually so fun; it was sad to be in there both ordering and listening to other people order. She was pretty short with the guy who ordered after us too.  He was dining in but had some questions about the menu; possibly she was still irritated after my order.    Not a good experience.  We love it here so I'm guessing we'll be back.  But lesson learned, dine in only.

I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, ""oh.""  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers.

Everything is pork, pork, pork, with some veal and tons of butter.  We've been too full to try many of the desserts.

My favorite is the salad.  I could honestly and truly take home a bucketful and be happy forever.  It's dressed with a light dill creamy dressing and contains marinated red kidney beans and beets (which I learned to love thanks to this salad) and a few other things that are just delicious.

I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.

Note though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.

I have to say that their olive bread is to die for.  After loading up on the carbs, you are ready for something refreshing.  The salads are beyond exceptional.  The ingredients are dripping with freshness, and feels like farm to table while you wait.  If you are looking for a sandwich, the Cubano is just the ticket.  The first time I went in, I asked the cashier what she recommended because I was having a hard time deciding.  She told me that her favorite, without a doubt, was the Cubano.  So, I gave it a shot.  Now, I need my fix at least once a week.  I think there is an addictive agent in that sandwich.  It's probably in the bread - ya know, the bread that they have calling and enticing you from the top of the display case like a seductress.  Oh, did I fail to mention that once they get you in their grip, you're soon turned onto the pastries and goodies in the display case???  They have so many to choose from, and each one looks delectable.  They even have vegan and gluten free, which I was skeptical about, but very happily surprised.

Not sure if you pay extra or have to get there early.  There was no air circulation and the acoustics were horrendous.

It is basically a warehouse with a concrete floor.  If you come here, bring earplugs and comfortable shoes otherwise you will leave early like we did hot, sweaty and half deaf.

So, I brought in a picture, let her know what I needed and she immediately got loud and argumentative and made a scene.  It actually was rather shocking to see her reaction, however, somehow it calmed down and she finally cut my hair.  Again, it wasn't what I asked for, so I contacted her the next day and asked for a refund.  She played a lot of games about that and when I contacted the owner Christie, her response was basically, ""She'll refund you, don't come in our salon again.""

We arrived a little early for our reservation and opted to sit at the bar and have a beer prior to sitting down to dinner. The bar tender was very friendly. The beer selection was excellent and priced reasonably. 

We were seated for our reservation on time. We chose to sit at the outdoor patio since the weather was cool by St. Louis standards. The outdoor patio was pleasant. The surroundings were quiet. One wouldn't know that they were in the middle of the city across from the brewery. 

We had the calamari and pot stickers for appetizers. The calamari is to die for! It is filleted and cooked in a seasoned butter sauce. It was very tender. This is the calamari that all others will be judged by henceforth. The pot stickers were good also, if not just a little salty for my tastes. 

I had a cheese and sun dried tomato stuffed chicken breast served over angel hair pasta for my main entree. It was excellent! I don't think I have ever had chicken breast quite so good. My daughter had the fillet Mignon and was very satisfied with it. My son-in-law had the fish special and was impressed as well. As a matter of fact he recommended it to the diners at the next table when they were wondering about it. 

For desert we tried the desert shots. They were just right after the scrumptious meal. I had the pecan pie shot and it was 3 bites of pure bliss!

cxupofYLq46bxBHpKyFwsQ,Wyndham New Orleans - French Quarter,New Orleans,LA,2,"Location: that is the reason I chose this hotel. However, after walking around the area many times I wish I had chosen one of the many other beautiful hotels in this area. 
Easy stuff first- The rooms: clean except the mattresses. Our mattress was highly stained and it was pretty sickening to look at. Didn't see any indication of bed bugs though so that's a plus. 
Bathroom came with plenty of lovely smelling soaps, body washes, hair supplies, and even a ""grooming kit."" 
The elevators are tricky, if you use the one to the far right it was super fast to arrive each time. If you tried to use any of the ones in the middle or right end, you'd wait for SO long. 
The location was great, easy to walk to Bourbon street and local restaurants, of course it's quite noisy at night from all the late-nighters who were a bit intoxicated, but that was to be expected considering we were so close to Bourbon street.  

The main reason I would not recommend this hotel is the sneaky attempts at selling vacation share/ownership. They give you incentives to attend a very nasty breakfast and lead you to believe it will be a total of an hour, well to spare the details it is well over 2 hours and caused us to miss morning plans in the city. They make you feel forced to stay and attend, If you refuse and decline the incentives then request your deposit back the staff turns incredibly rude. At which point you are forced to walk back to the hotel instead of taking the shuttle back (which is how you get to the ""VIP"" location).  It's something that reading fine print in the offer would save you the trouble of going through, but unfortunately they are good at talking and just saying ""initial here/sign here"" to get you locked in. Our stupidity to not read the fine print left us in this incredibly ridiculous outcome. 
When I stay at a nice hotel I want to be treated as a guest, not as a sales opportunity. It was worse than going to a car dealership and dealing with a car salesman.

I saw a white rabbit dash into Taco Mamacitas, and I followed him. His coattails flapped in the drizzle.

""I'm late. I'm late,"" he kept muttering, checking his clock, looking on fleek in Imogen and Willie jeans. 

I opened the door, and saw him scurry down a passageway, and I bounded after him. I chased him down a dark passage and opened a heavy door, and stumbled into Wonderland.

A giant metallic shell stood in a corner, grabbing my neck and yanking it upwards. I searched and couldn't find the ceiling, so high it was. Concrete slabs laid crudely everywhere, like a giant's playpen. People milled about amiably. I looked for the White Rabbit, but he was busy ordering a drink at the bar.

I walked around, unsure whether I was in a bar, or in some trippy Brooklyn underground scene. The music poured from everywhere, and for a second, I was sure that the DJ was inside the metallic chimney. He wasn't, but he should be, replete with disco lights, spinning tunes from his Rapunzel tower, letting down his golden beats and taking us all higher.

I have no words for this place, except a great sadness that it didn't exist before. The drinks were well priced and the options many. Food came in from somewhere, but I didn't feel like eating at that point. The place has all the class, and none the pretentiousness that such joints typically attract...for now.

I got the oxtail soup (Sancocho) with extra rice and plantains to see how it would differ from the Korean-style stuff I was used to at home. Aside from a thicker, stew-like broth and beefier potatoes, it was just as delicious. My friend got a flat steak (Carne Asada) that I think he ate in just under 10 seconds.

5iuo1kvv0XZMS0bUOoLz2Q,Bistro St. Tropez,Philadelphia,PA,5,"I'm honestly shocked at the negative reviews.  I'd like to first respond by suggesting that you take someone's review based on a restaurant week experience with a grain of salt.  Seriously...  it's restaurant week, and you're someone who wants to be a hip, know-it-all foodie for 1 week but otherwise orders out for pizza.

I've eaten here many many (emphasis on many) times and have never been disappointed with the food.  If you want to be sure that they don't prepare the food & leave it under the heat lamp for ages, as one reviewer speculated, just look in the little circular window as you walk in and watch them make it. There are no secret cover-ups. 

Lunch is pretty busy, since the restaurant is located on the 4th floor of an interior design building and there really aren't a lot of other places in the immediate area, but the sandwiches  are such a great alternative to the typical hoagie fare.   
my lunch favorite: Cocotte - white meat chicken salad with grapes, basil, apple, walnuts, celery and dijon mayonnaise on pita bread.

The salads are large and there's a diverse selection.. not just garden salad vs. caesar, but some unique and creative combinations and they are definitely satisfying on their own.

Get the sweet potato fries!

Dinner time is almost never crowded. You probably don't need a reservation unless it's a special event. Ask to sit by a window, the views (in either room) are incredible. You get the river with the bridge lit up at night, 30th street station and, though it's better to see during the day, the art museum. The lack of crowds mean you can have an intimate conversation with your guests comfortably.

Patrice is amazing. It is not often that the owner/chef of a restaurant will come out during dinner to go table to table and ask if everything is OK. His accent will also make you melt, which is always a plus for me.

I think it's usually empty because of its location. There is not much around and it can be a little shady at night time, but if you can quickly shuffle a couple blocks to Chestnut or Walnut, you're back in the mix of it all again, safe and sound.",2010-03-26,NEGATIVE,0.9496756196022034
bRhnVTfuxDchyFguyDzuDQ,Queen Sushi,Glenside,PA,2,"I'm always getting menus from Chinese restaurants and pizzerias, but when you have your standbys, it's not easy for a new place to catch your eye. The menu for Queen came this week, and I wanted to try a few things from their rather large vegetarian selection. They have the usual veggie and bean curd (a.k.a. tofu) entrees, but they also have mock chicken, beef, and duck. We actually ordered carryout the same day I read the menu - I was excited!

The food was okay, but I have to admit, it was disappointing. Part of me wants to try another few dishes, but that part is being told to quiet down and not be so charitable. 

First up - moo shu vegetables. I usually love the cabbage and sweet sauce, and this had the bonus of including broccoli, baby corn, and mushrooms. But the pancakes were dry, stuck together, and inedible. The corn tasted like a can. Not great.

Next, vegetarian ""beef"" with mixed vegetables. The beef tasted like my homemade attempts at seitan, where the stuff still tastes like flour. The sauce was good, but the dish was unremarkable. 

Finally, we ordered one of the Chef's Specialties - bean curd with general tso's sauce. The silken tofu was deep fried and coated with a sticky, sugary sauce, and there were a few pieces of broccoli alongside. Very disappointing - no spice, no heat, and just sugar and fat for appeal. 

The two star rating means I've had better. My absolute favorite is Wild Ginger in Huntingdon Valley, and I also prefer China Garden Inn in Willow Grove. I was hoping for a good take out place closer to home, but this isn't it.",2013-04-14,NEGATIVE,0.9891340136528015

SaUbh0sMSev8gKNJYtC76g,Hob Nob,Santa Barbara,CA,4,"I attended the soft opening for this new restaurant and bar. It's in the space that was formerly Epiphany Restaurant, and is under the same ownership and management. I guess they decided to go in a different direction and name.

The folks are the same, but the menu is different. Sort of fancy traditional American mixed with California cuisine. It's not just mac and cheese but truffle mac and cheese. 

The soft opening was anything but! The doors opened at 6 and it was packed by 7. There is a good level of cougers and douchebags there, and HobNob appears to have anticipated that, and offer a signature drink called a Couger Cooler. 
What was soft about the opening was a limited menu, which they were very upfront about so we were well aware that the kitchen was still preparing and the staff was getting oriented. Parts of the restaurant were even still under construction.

I was there with thirsty friends and we sampled three cocktails: the Hunny Sunshine (or sunset?), with muddled ginger , the Old Pom with bourbon and pomegranate syrup, and the Cucumber Crush with, you guessed it, crushed cucumber! Of these three, we liked the Old Pom and the Cucumber best. 

Nibbles included a selection of bread rolls - rosemary, sundried tomato and plain - with a fat wodge of butter, and an appetizer order of the Mac Daddy, their spiral pasta with cheese sauce and toasted crumb topping flavored with truffle. 

The guys at the bar, Andy and Ace, were kept on their toes with many many drink orders, they stayed organized and even added a little flourish here and there.

The service was very slow and the waitress spent most of the time chatting with her fellow employees and essentially ignoring us.  

The menu was misleading - it lists a combo of ""all vegetables"" for $15, but really you just get 8 items of their choosing - the ""Queen's Eight"" platter.  Our waitress didn't even know this, until I questioned after she only brought us 6 items, and she had to ask someone else.  It seems unfair to charge the exact same price for a vegetarian platter as for one with meat dishes.  

Every other place I've visited served the combo platter on a big piece of injera spread out on a large plate but here they serve a few (very small) portions of items on a couple of strips of injera.  Their injera was a disgrace!  As some other reviewers have noted, it was slightly dried out and the edges were crusty!  To top it off, the veggie items were maybe lukewarm, at best, and pretty bland for Ethiopian cuisine.  

As we finished up our meal, I chose to eat a salvageable portion of the injera that had all the juices soaked into it.  Unfortunately hiding underneath it was a long black hair!

fEFCglnS2V7MzqoxBoJVWA,Pei Wei,Moorestown,NJ,4,"Getting into a PF Changs can be frustrating since they fill up very quickly and the wait times can be long. When I need a PF Chang food fix and am in a hurry, I go to this Pei Wei. The menu has several similar offerings and the prices are better although it has a cafeteria style service vibe. The orange peel dishes (beef, chicken, shrimp) are a favorite. As mentioned by some, the food can be inconsistent - outstanding once time and just OK another. My hit rate is about 80% positive with the shrimp occasionally being bland and the rice not as moist as I like (although easily fixed with lots of soy sauce). Bottomless soda and fortune cookies keep the kids happy too. 

The place can be noisy and the selection is limited to keep prices low but overall it's easily a 3 1/2 star to 4 star place. We eat here about once a month and like it for what it is - fast, tasty food. 

Recommended - especially if you are in a hurry or are bringing along the kids...

The woman running the front desk was very welcoming and was expecting us. I had told her on the phone that I wanted a strong deep tissue massage and she hooked me up with a really fabulous young woman. It was one of the best massages I've ever had. I really liked that she asked me what I wanted. She tailored the massage to my needs (neck and shoulders) rather than going through the motions and doing my whole body. My sister and I had massages in the same room at the same time, and it was nice that we could do that. 

Cons (I'm extremely picky and mostly pointing this out to help Massage Envy, not to dissuade): I did not love how the receptionists are at the front desk loudly making confirmation calls while you're sitting waiting for the massage therapist. But My sister wasn't as thrilled by her massage person. There were only enough hooks for one person's stuff in our double room.Our therapists chatted amongst themselves a bit more than we would have preferred. 

Overall, highly recommended! I am a member, so I can get my massages at the local member price, which in Tampa is pretty low. It's a bargain for a lovely service!",2011-01-10,POSITIVE,0.9997666478157043

The tator tots were amazing, and we also had some hot chocolate muffins with raspberry jam that were moist and delicious.

It's one of the best Happy Hours in this area of the city, especially if you're broke like me. If you ""win"" one of their happy hours, you (and anyone who gives your name at the door) gets free entry, free appetizer buffet, and 2 $1 drink tickets. How do you win? Attend a happy hour and insert a contact card at the door. I've been twice, and ""won"" twice. Maybe it's a coincidence. Or maybe everyone wins. No complaints either way.

It's a perfectly decent spot to get some free food and start your night, but it can get pretty busy post-happy hour and their drink prices are not the best if you're not benefiting from the $1 tickets. Seating is kind of limited, and if you're not lucky enough to grab a table before it gets crowded, you'll be stuck standing all night. The crowd is typically a mixture of mid-30's bachelorette parties and 21 year olds, and it can get really crowded and rowdy on weekends.

We ordered the toasted ravs for an appetizer.  These rank up there with some of the best I've had.  I ordered the spinach and prosciutto pizza.  My wife had the cannolli.  The PILs ordered the Straw and Hay and the Chocolate Fettuccine and a house salad.

Everyone raved about their food.  Naturally, as an Italian restaurant, they gave us more food than we could eat.  Another nice touch was the dinner rolls with hummus rather than the traditional olive oil or butter.

She made sure to only show me frames that reflected what shape and style I wanted, and ones that were within my price range. I never felt pressured to go with something more expensive, and she helped me narrow down to a few frames that I really loved. Both Nancy and Mark gave me their honest opinions on which frames flattered me best, and with their help, I picked out the perfect frames!

PTzwrdncs2O-uZkPHH4m9w,West Elm,Indianapolis,IN,3,This is a fun store to explore. Lots to look at. This review is for two chairs I ordered a year ago. I finally decided to special order two of their swoop swivel velvet chairs. You don't have an option to pickup in the store. You have to pay extra for their white glove delivery.  It took a good two months for them to be made and delivered. The delivery guys cut the upholstery on one when they unpacked the chair.  They saw it but waited for me to notice it. I had to call the store manager (who was amazing) to get another one ordered. That took another two months. They look nice but are not holding up well at all. The swivel part is bending and the chairs list to one side. They are not in constant use so I'm assuming it's a manufacturing defect. When I called customer service I discovered they don't stand behind or warranty their furniture. I don't recommend buying their upholstered pieces.,2016-09-07,NEGATIVE,0.9070081114768982

The food is different but delicious, the funky vibe is FUN, and its one of the few places I feel 100% comfortable going to eat at alone. 

A majority of the time, I order the meat and 2-sides, especially if I am in a hurry. I always get the Southwest Chicken Salad and the spicy noodles... my second side is different every time. But I'm super loyal to the first two. I used to always ask for it to-go, because I couldn't finish the plate and it made for a wonderful snack later in the day. Quick, easy and a great value. 

The last couple of times I've gone, however, I don't get nearly as much food as I once did.I've gone from, ""Wow what a great value!"" to, ""Eh, didn't get as much food as I paid for...""

We had the email with the confirmation so went back to the register to ask about it. Again, the manager was very rude and just said ""what does your groupon say- it says you have to have a reservation"" and walked away again.

U30ggGzFpXvc2NZYwOW3qg,Mood Cafe,Philadelphia,PA,4,"I have been here twice since it has opened. First of all, great signage. It is extremely clear what your options are: Lassi, fresh fruit juice, shaved ice, milk shakes, and ice cream amongst other options. There are a few interesting flavors that I have yet to try, including the salt lassi (buttermilk) and sandalwood. 

The owner is extremely nice. He takes time to talk to customers about what goes into each item that is ordered. He's also plied us with a few generous samples of milkshakes, lassi, and ice cream. 

I have had a strawberry and mango milkshake so far and have sampled lassi ordered by a few of my friends. Everything was tasty. You know when a milkshake is good and everything is where it needed to be. We also sampled the fresh watermelon juice. It was like drinking a watermelon. 

FYI, the shakes are lighter than the lassi, so if you want something on the lighter side go with one of those.

9nkYaCQRyO0fi8SrXDFhGw,Rittenhouse Market,Philadelphia,PA,2,"The selection here is not great, and neither are the prices. The number of groceries and markets in the neighborhood is limited, so this place unfortunately the only place to get certain items in the immediate area. 

The Maxx's is the best market overall in the area, and Food & Friends has an okay selection, despite their high prices, Rittenhouse Market is the only place in the area where you can get some items.

For example, unless you want to walk to Trader Joe's, or rely only upon deli meats and sausage, Rittenhouse is the only place in the area to get meat and fish. The meat isn't great. The fish is okay/good, and at least it's not badly priced.

Considering that there are other places are easily within walking distance, only of the only advantages of Rittenhouse is it's size. It's the largest ""supermarket"" in the area, and so can provide a one stop shop for food and house hold items. 

That said, there's a hardware store just around the corner, Maxx's and Trader Joe's within walking distance, and a smattering of other shops slightly further away (not to mention Reading Terminal market, which is a 12 minute walk from here).",2014-02-25,NEGATIVE,0.9358351230621338

I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked 'is this better princess "".  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I've had a gel polish color change several times before, no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER,  i don't know why she did.

The decor of the restaurant is decent. The service was ok, nothing great but satisfactory. We ordered several items including a seaweed soup, speciality roll, sashimi, and a more basic roll. The soup was ok, lacked flavor but not too bad. The sashimi was decent, tasted like it had been sitting for a while. The sushi was not good -- tasted old and was actually somewhat dark in color. The other roll was actually difficult to eat -- it tasted stale and old. The menu said ""tempura"" style, but what we actually got was a fried piece of I don't know. 

I travel regularly on business and have experienced some excellent sushi in Seattle, San Francisco, Dallas, and even here in Philly there are some excellent spots in neighboring Chestnut Hill and even a 1/2 way decent buffet on the other side of 476 in Plymouth meeting.

This quaint restaurant is decorated with all kinds of flowers. There are flowers decorating the patio, flowers in wreaths hanging on the inside, there is even a (fake) tree where the host stand is located. There is gorgeous décor in the restaurant from the tables and chairs where their guests sit to the marble countertops to the restroom. The owner does a wonderful job of creating an elegant getaway for people all over.
The first thing I noticed was all the beautiful and delicious treats that were on display. There were three layer cakes, cookies, macaroons, pies, and even a three-layer cake with cookies on top!
A smiling face seated my friend and me immediately. She was very sweet and even gave us recommendations on what to order because this was my first time here. I ordered a Rose Cappuccino and a piece of the Raspberry Champagne Cake. We only waited five minutes before our server brought out our drinks, and then maybe other ten or so minutes until she brought our cake to us.
The presentation of the cake and the cappuccinos was exquisite. The cappuccino was delicious and foamy with sprinkled mini rose petals on top. The cake was delicious as well, with three layers of white cake and layers of a raspberry covered in a delicious, light vanilla frosting, garnished with a raspberry.

S---    Honey's was so-so!!!

This pretty much sums it up.  I had pumpkin pancakes. They had far too much cinnamon. Also had eggs and potatos. The potatos were good, I suppose.  My boyfriend had a Poorboy, and thought it was mediocre at best too.  Not bad, Not good, just average.  Add the over-crowded atmosphere... and the place is just not worth standing in the rain for 20 minutes, (which some people did) or sitting in a tightly packed waiting area with somebody's BUTT in your face for 20 minutes.

LOL)  In their favor, I will say Honey's was cozy... it was a cold and rainy day, and I appreciated that Honey's had their heat on, unlike some other hipster spots that insist on having the a/c cranked up all year long!

The best part of my meal was my english breakfast tea... which I could have bought at any Target store and made myself at home. In short, Honey's is ok, but not worthy of more than 2 stars.

I know, bold statement, right?  It's actually Asian fusion, as they have a mega-extensive menu of Chinese and Japanese staples.  I don't eat sushi, but from what I've heard from my co-diners, this place's sushi is very good, and they even have an all-you-can-eat sushi night on Wednesday (I think, unless they've changed their tune recently).  The food is good, the price is right, and the service is outstanding.  It's definitely a treat for those of us stuck living in South Jersey, but with Philly-style tastes.

I don't know why... it's just the right amount of sticky.  And oh so good.  Mock me if you will, but I purposely order things that come with a side of white rice (most of it does, but I always make sure).

I discovered this place while I attended Rowan back in the day, and I like to venture back every now and then with the BF for some yumness.  For being on a college campus, I've never really seen it super packed, and there's a good mixed demographic in there, not just a bunch of frat kids all the time, so that's nice.  Very cheesey decor, in a good way, and they have cute little booths to one side with pillows and stuff - very Asian-y.  Tokyo Mandarin is definitely a good time.",2009-05-27,POSITIVE,0.9997740387916565
fWMPbickerGWohPy2vDL5A,Ulta Beauty,Plainfield,IN,4,I went into the store today because I had a $5 off coupon and I was looking for a drug store bb/cc cream. I walked around for a little looking at higher end products then made my way around to the drug store products. A worker who was super busy (the store was restocking) stopped to ask me if I needed help. After talking for a few minutes and listening to me suggested I go over to the Clinique bar. The girls there were super helpful! They color matched me with a lightweight foundation after she did a section she went and did my full face and even did some concealer. After she finished she made me some samples of the products and gave me a sample of a primer because I mentioned my pores on my nose are huge. All in all super helpful!

tQ6VNQ9ezkxRE4bvu9WShQ,CBQ Cowboy Bar & 'Que,Sparks,NV,3,"I really wanted to like this place, but as so many others found, the food just isn't up to par. The only reason this is bumped up to a three-star review is because of the service, it was stellar from start to finish.

I ordered the classic cheeseburger, and my husband ordered the tri-tip sandwich with gorgonzola at the recommendation of our server, Rhonda (she was awesome). My husband took one bite of his sandwich, which arrived very promptly, and said ""it has no flavor, and it's chewy."" I had the same thing to say about my burger. It was clearly hand formed, but it had absolutely no flavor. It seems the chef here has no concept of seasoning. Perhaps he wants his barbecue sauce to shine, and the sauce is very tasty, according to my husband, but in a barbecue place, the meat should shine too, and here, it certainly does not. 

All of the sandwiches come without sides, so my husband ordered a side of fries, ""extra crispy,"" as he always does. The side, which was pretty small for the price ($2), arrived, and they were chewy, not crispy at all. By the time he was done with his sandwich, he had to eat it with a knife and fork, because it became so soggy, it just fell apart, and it was impossible to eat as a hand-held sandwich. 

All in all, the service here is amazing. From the hostess greeting us warmly, to Rhonda helping us through the menu, and the manager stopping by, everyone was friendly, and extremely helpful. That doesn't make up for the lackluster food, however.

OPiBkXv9gHRoNv8lvdzPQg,Greyhound Bus Lines,Mount Laurel,NJ,3,"I have been riding the mt laurel greyhound to New York City for about 6 years now. While the greyhound is definitely not my favorite mode of transport, I must admit that the service has greatly improved since I first started riding the bus.

I used to HATE the greyhound so much..always late, rude staff, and dirty buses. I would have literally given it 0 stars if I could. However, somewhere along the way, they seem to have revamped their system a bit. In the past year of taking the greyhound, the bus has been late only a handful of times. And usually only by 10-30 minutes max, compared with the 1-2hour delays I would frequently experience in the past. The staff, who used to be terrible, now willingly allows refunds and greets you with a warm smile. The company must have realized they were doing something wrong.

And while the buses are still not spotless, they are a definite improvement. The new buses now come with outlets and leather seats. 

I'm not sure if I would call the greyhound a ""great"" bus. But I must say that they have come a long way and I'm glad to see improvement. There are limited ways to get to NYC from the mt laurel / cherry hill area and I'm glad they are trying to make the service better for those who depend on the greyhound!!",2017-01-28,POSITIVE,0.6843445301055908

In fact today a wonderful salesperson dissuaded me from buying the overly expensive starter kit and rather get me a tea I liked,  a tin, & tumbler on sale!

I was thoroughly impressed with the staff who were able to guess exactly which tea I wanted after I blankly starred at them and said ""I dunno I think it's green tea based with fruit..."" Even more impressive was the reassurance that you will know if you will like the tea simply by smell, I didn't believe it but totally true.

The menu is strictly dumplings and we went with the crab and pork mixture; 8 dumplings for $12. Note to everyone,  cash only for orders under $25. Thankfully we came prepared. First came out a bowl of chicken broth for each of us. I tasted it and it made me worry for the dumplings. The broth was quite similar to water with very little seasoning and not the greatest flavor. But then the little bundles of joy came out, pretty quickly I might add. The lady behind the counter was extremely sweet and asked if this was our first time as we were googling the art of dumpling eating. She explained the best way to go about it and said many people mix and match each dumpling with the provided soy sauce, rice vinegar, and chili sauce. The broth within the dumpling was seasoned to perfection and our only complaint was that there wasn't more in each little dumpling pocket. The dumplings themselves were divine as well, packed with meat and flavor. The 4 stars comes from the rather steep price for the amount of tiny sized dumplings you get.

The space looks totally different, in a good way. I was pretty much sold when I saw the chalkboard with the names of local vendors they use and I recognized most of them from the Franklin Farmer's Market. 

It was a great lunch for my family. I was able to get a bunless burger on a very nice salad of mixed greens. My husband got some burger all loaded up with toppings.  The fries are great!  I was trying to eat healthy, but couldn't resist them.

The fact that the kids meals come with fries AND apple slices AND they serve Hatcher Dairy Milk (the best milk in these parts, IMO) made me a happy mom.  Both my boys liked and ate their meals.

The service was just okay. I'm not sure what kind of vibe they are hoping for.  The hostess was VERY friendly. She welcomed everyone and asked about how their day was, etc.  Once we were seated, it seemed most of the servers were cool guys in skinny jeans.  They were getting the job done, but I kind of got the feeling we weren't quite hip enough for them. No warm fuzzies once we got to our table. 

As other reviewers have said, the seating is close together.  I wouldn't want to be there on a date night, but for a family lunch I loved it. Now, the people sitting next to us, who got an upclose and personal performance from my three year old, might have had a totally different experience. :)

It's like The Boot, for grownups. If you're into that, please don't tell me, because I will judge you. 

What? I'm just being honest. 

That said, Lucy's is not a bad place to have lunch if you work downtown, and I've done that on more than one occasion. As a sort-of vegetarian-ish, the only thing on the menu that I've ever ordered (and therefore I assume that it's the only thing on the menu that I CAN order, but don't quote me on this because I couldn't tell you for sure without actually seeing a menu again) is the quesedilla, which I am just now realizing I have no idea how to spell. Nor does Firefox spellcheck, evidently, because the options are ""questionable"" through ""Queensland"" and not the word I'm looking for. But I digress.

The one thing that I order but can't spell from Lucy's is pretty good, not overly expensive, and you can also go here for late-ish night drunk food in addition to lunch, which I've also done. 

Besides food and creepy middle aged men hitting on inappropriately younger girls who are apparently into that, the best thing about Lucy's is to sit outside with a bucket of beer during happy hour, and count how many cars blow the stop sign at that intersection. Lucy's is on the corner of Girod and Tchoupitoulas, and it's a four way stop. However, for some reason the vast majority of people do not seem to realize this. It's definitely entertaining, and would actually make for a good drinking game now that I think about it. 

Lucy's: Go for lunch, a bucket of beer and after-work entertainment, or to reassure yourself that you've ""still got it"" by being hit on or hitting on insecure or aging, collar-popping strangers.

-Tnsc_b8dsWuAq1wQugKZA,Mi Tenampa,Indianapolis,IN,1,"This restaurant was the worst experience that I've had in Indianapolis to date. A coworker and I decided to go to lunch today at a Mexican restaurant that she recommend it. It was my first mind to go somewhere else but I decided to try something new and Yelp something different for a change. Mistake! 

Upon entering we saw the sign for the lunch special wish we were both excited about, hey $5.99! We sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. She showed us the lunch menu. I decided to get the taco special and 1 chicken tamale to try (im still seachung for great tamales). Of course like a few other places that I have been too lately, my waitress comes from the kitchen to announce no tamles are ready for today.  Interesting because it's noon and you don't have my ready but you opened at 11am... #ICant

I let it go (and took off a star), getting ready for my  taco lunch with onions and cilantro extra cheese. It came out in due time  only to find out I was not very happy with the food at all. Actually took me a little while to eat my second taco. The positive thing about the meal was the portions. The two tacos were large. It just did not taste like authentic Mexican tacos. It tastes like something that I could easily make at home. American best-try kind-of tacos. Another star gone. 

We ready to go soon enough and we ask for separate check which the waiter said that she could do. However she did not bring out separate checks. In fact my coworker had to ask how much her meal was. The waitress had to go back and count up for her total and then come back and tell her how much the her portion was. Well knowing that I only spent about $7 in the restaurant I did not think I needed to do the same. Mistake. I was very surprised when found out my meal was almost $11 when my card was ran. Apparently it was extra for the cilantro onion even know the meal came with tomatoes and lettuce which I asked for instead. Never was told it was extra. I knew I had to pay for extra chees, but dang!  Management came out upon my request to give me a breakdown of the bill, especially since I couldn't get itemized bill. I was not happy, not buying the explaination, nor impressed. They give me a small, change of a refund and vowed to NEVER be back. 

No tamales, no detailed bill, no prior knowledge of changes would be extra, food not great at all... Yeah, you have ok decor and yes you smiled but service is lacking, never again. #EpicEpicEpicFail",2014-03-14,NEGATIVE,0.99620121717453

Starting with the PROS:
Affordability (however they have raised prices on their shorter massages, but their longer and combo massages are a good deal)

Flexibility of hours and ease of getting an appointment (you can call and always get an appointment same day) - great for walk-ins.  The quality of the massages are pretty much on par with others I've received at other places in the city.

Variety - you can get any kind of combo package that includes deep tissue, swedish, hot stone, foot reflexology - or one that includes only one of them or all of them.

Ending with the CONS:
If you're not a local it might be hard to find, it's above the Penn Herb store on the 2nd floor, entrance is on Green Street -

Just a warning, this place is not super modern-y spa - It's basic.  The ambience isn't the most calming or serene... it's got a bit of a hippy- trippy - eclectic vibe with crazy wall colors.  The space and rooms are pretty dated - bare-bones... The place could stand to get a few renovations.

The place as it reads is a Center and NOT a spa, so don't expect bathrobes or slippers, or hair ties.  The massage rooms and sheets are clean, but also, clearly old  (the sheets on all my visits had clearly been washed and used alot, they were pilled).

The rooms could also stand to be just a little bit darker and a little less noisy... because of its location, it is to be expected you'll hear traffic noise here and there (and depending on when you're getting your massage)

If you're looking to get a lot of massages and are worried about cost, this place is definitely for you.  If you could care less about decor and ambience and prefer a basic, no-frills experience - this place is also for you.",2008-12-15,POSITIVE,0.9986411929130554

It seems antithetical that what I consider the best Chinese food in St. Louis isn't located on South Grand, or in the Asian-American part of Olive, but underneath a retirement home off of 170 and Delmar. The food here is the best Chinese food I've had outside of the three months I spent in China. The Szechuan Beef in particular is amazing, with a crispy outside, and an amazing sauce garnished with hot peppers. The General Tso's Chicken has enough garlic to ruin the evening of your significant other, and huge hunks of ginger that compliment the crispy chicken perfectly. Even their pot stickers are done well, and they come with a great sweet and sour sauce and a mustard/horseradish mix that will blow your sinuses away.

The restaurant is small and the tables are packed closely together.  There is a whole lot going on in terms of decoration, so it can be a bit of a sensory overload.  

Overall, the service was excellent and very quick, especially considering there only appeared to be two servers for the entire dining room.  We tried a few appetizers, all ok but nothing special.  We both had dim sum, mine only mildly spicy and his quite spicy, and both enjoyed our dishes.

Nothing special or innovative. Yawn. Our server was friendly and took our drink order. She dropped the drinks off and said she would be right with us. We drank our drinks and waited...

It most certainly isn't what you'd expect from a typical food truck with their flavor packed menu. My favorite things to get are the Cap'n Crunch Tilapia Burrito and their Chicken Katsu. Portions are enough to fill me up on my lunch break and I always leave satisfied with a tasty meal and a full stomach.

Around noon is when they are busiest which when you'll likely have to wait quite a bit longer than usual, but to be honest their food is worth it. My typical order is the chicken katsu with an egg on top. It comes with a nicely crunched chicken fillet on a bed of rice with some avocado and salads on the side along with the option to make it spicy or not (I personally put spicy mayo). Everything is freshly made each day and you can definitely taste it when you dig in. 

The workers there are extremely sociable and always greet you with a smile and they seem like they enjoy serving their customers. This truck will keep me coming for the remainder of my time at Drexel.

3IjpO8tHrDkltcshN_m-7g,Southwest Airlines,Tucson,AZ,1,"Fair warning, this is gonna be a long one, involving multiple locations and Southwest's ""Customer Service"".  

I was heading out this past Thursday to make my cousin's HS graduation in east TX.  My first warning this would be the trip from hell was a text warning me of a delay in Tucson (TUS).  I live an hour & a half east of TUS, but decided to leave the house as originally planned to ensure I could speak to a gate agent.  

My layover was to be 45 minutes in Denver, yet the delay was already 55 minutes due to weather according to the SW gate agent in TUS.  I was quickly informed I wouldn't make my Denver (DEN) departure.  What ensued was a crazy spider web of options having me fly to LAX, staying overnight in DEN, flying to Houston, then Dallas Love Field (DAL), my final destination...arriving at 5:45pm, with a 7pm graduation to make two hours away.  No Go!  Finally the gate agent said, ""Can you drive to Phoenix?...there's a flight leaving at 7:40pm.""  Realizing I had a nearly two hour drive, she quickly changed my flight & I hauled butt off-site to pick up my car & drive to PHX. 

During the drive I realized the gate agent hadn't rescheduled my return flight & my car would be parked in PHX.  I quickly parked at the closest lot so I could speak to a gate agent, the parking later costing me $75 for a three day stay.  I stood for 45 minutes while the poor gate agent, Nancy, tried every way she could to reschedule my return flight so I could reunite with my car.  The system repeatedly gave her error messages & she couldn't even check in a stroller for two dazed parents.  All her calls to her supervisor yielded no physical response.  Nancy did her best, calling everyone she could & finally informed me ""for future reference, ensure the original agent changes your return flight too.""  A tad too late in this instance & I just had to board the plane, resorting to a Facebook post that yielded a possible ride from TUS to get my car in PHX, something I didn't want to use.  Nancy entered some notes & told me to call the 1-800-I-FLY-SWA customer service number to reschedule once in Texas.   Sadly, this was the tip of the iceberg.  

The flight, pilots & flight attendants were wonderful.  I arrived 55 minutes later than my original flight, thankful the rental car company was still available.  What was terrible was the website & lack of customer service at FLY SWA.   Over two days I called eight times, spending a total of 4 hours, 18 minutes & 49 seconds desperately trying to get a human on the line.  As a tip - SW get some decent Muzak!  I stayed up til 4am freaking out because no one would respond, despite two messages saying I would get a call back in 15 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively.  I made two Facebook posts, even messaging them, with FB communications rep Lindsey no help.  During one hour+ session on hold I did a Google search & discovered that SW's website had gone into ""meltdown"" & their phone lines were overwhelmed due to their recent low fare sale.

Sure enough, I checked the website, & was booted off repeatedly.  I was in full-on panic now because it showed I had no upcoming flights, listing my departure was on my original TUS flight, with my return the rescheduled flight out of PHX - stupid considering this would've meant that I was in the air at the same time on two separate flights!  It was a very sleepless night imagining I was going to have to book another very expensive, short-notice, flight just to get back to my car. 

Finally my cousin said ""to hell with SW, let's go to Walmart & buy some wine!""  Once again, I was on the phone, on hold buying a kiddie pool & booze when an angel named Rhonda finally answered.  24 minutes later I finally had a direct return flight to PHX, with a three hour drive home when I returned.

I have always loved the flight crews & agents at SW.  I love that they give snacks on the plane & their in-flight cocktails are reasonably priced.  But this was a very stressful ""adventure"" I don't ever want to repeat.  After all was said & done, Rhonda informed me I somehow have a miraculous credit of $133 I must use in the next two months.  I am searching for a brave soul to purchase the ticket for since I really don't want to fly SW ever again.  Sadly, SW is typically more expensive than other carriers, particularly since I rarely need to check a bag, & if I do, it's always free since I'm in the military. In addition, there's no assigned seating for the extra cost.  (As a comedian once said ""Ever fly Southwest?...One thru Forty...GO!!!"")  I might also add that most other carriers will let military pre-board, while Southwest does not.  

I sincerely hope my experience this past weekend was a rare one & dedicated flyers fare better than I.",2015-06-09,NEGATIVE,0.9990254640579224

As much as I love the food here, my review is only a four star due to the seating policy. I can understand restaurant not taking reservations, but the restaurant also has a policy that they will only seat when all parties have arrived. The parking is extremely limited - so limited the restaurant had to apply for a variance for parking. This means if you have to park on the street and want to drop off an elderly person or your spouse and young children, they will not be seated until you have parked and walked to the restaurant. Once in the pouring rain my husband dropped me at the door with our infant son, and the restaurant staff refused to seat me because my husband wasn't there yet, despite my explanation that he was trying to find a parking spot on the street since their lot was full. There were several open tables and instead of letting me get settled with a few month old baby, they insisted that I wait at the drafty entrance. I left and went elsewhere. I laughed out loud when we showed up for Mother's Day brunch a couple months later and was asked if I had a reservation.

I tried it too, and it was a fantastic treat. Their Crab Bisque rocks, and it's a decent sized portion.

We've had their giant Lüke burgers and loved them too, they're fantastic, and prepared perfectly. In fact, we brought their burgers back on the plane last year, and they were delectable.

Service - first pho restaurant I've ever been to where they don't hover around you for you to order. We had to flag down the waiter. 

The spring rolls had too much basil in it and were a little on the small side. Plus the sauce was more sweet than savory. 

The pho was good I think. The broth was well balanced and flavorful. I could live in Nashville and be happy with it. Also the pho is probably on the of the most reasonably priced items. Some items are probably more difficult to make. I saw Banh hoi for more than 12 bucks.

The mixologist had a little something special up her sleeve though and poured a creative, yummy apricot bourbon substitute beverage. All in the group of seven were pleased with their cocktail selection, with the exception of the dry martini. The food, however, was a bit a let-down. 

As what I'm learning is an unfortunate theme in this town, it was a bit expensive for the quality of the meal. My eggplant lasagna was warm at best with very little flavor to it. Fortunately (or unforuntunately, depending on how you see it) I had gorged on the cheese plate(s) and was already too full to have more than a few bites. My fellow diners agreed their meals were okay but not would probably not come back and order again.

I prefer to go there when I can get an outside table, or when I visit with a particular group of friends who also share in my sentiment of fondness. Now what the heck took me so long to experience Zorba's delivery?! Shame on me. It's the same delicious food, just in my pajamas in front of my TV. 

Having experienced a day that could only be fixed by delivery, my husband handled all of the order details. I believe he placed directly with them, as we were able to pay in cash when the delivery guy arrived. The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts. 

I'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce soufflé, I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice, veggies and potatoes, all separated by little dividers as to not mingle. 

We were first timers to the Skordalia. Think extra, extra whipped mashed potatoes with extra, extra garlic. Move over (already fabulous hummus), you may have just been replaced in our repertoire. Okay, I kid. We'll just get both and have leftovers.

Speaking of leftovers, we totally were able to split our order into two meals. Score!  

Love that fresh bread they put on the table? Don't worry, you get that too.

I went there based upon the 4.5 star review hoping for a great little sandwich place in the Metairie side of town. The grocery store looked pretty great, but the sandwich bar on a Saturday at lunchtime was abysmal, and the worst place I've paid money to eat since moving here several weeks ago. 

The service consisted of ""What do you want?"" followed by the staff contuing their conversation and offering no help at all. The turkey sandwich my wife bought was shaved lettice and tomato on a plain white hamburger bun. Hardly worth the $7 we paid. My ""hot sausage po boy"" was some kind of pressed mass of orange meat with more shredded ""lettuce"".  The only redeemable thing about the whole meal was the package of cole slaw that made it edible.

I have been here three or four times for haircuts, twice for brow waxing, and just had my first spa pedicure and aromatherapy massage/wrap (AMAZING, btw). I have never once had a bad experience - not with service, result, or personality.

While it's important for your time-planning to know that they do take a lot of time, I really can't see it negatively that they are thorough and precise about everything they do, and since they work calmly and happily, it's really a very relaxing atmosphere - even the waxing! I actually got a little irritated by the girl next to me having a pedicure, watching the student intently with her arms crossed. I guess she had to go, but I was like, Geez, can't you relax, this is awesome! And you know, I'm not going to complain about taking some extra time on an aromatherapy massage at ALL.

Whenever I've been there, they've seemed to strike a fairly good balance between talking to you and knowing when you just want to be switched off for a while. Which is hard to recognize - I noticed another reviewer wasn't happy the girl didn't talk to her, whereas I prefer not to have to talk much at all. 

I can really speak more to the atmosphere than the precise results, since I'm not the kind of person who gets anything fancy done, but I've always loved their work despite me sitting there going, ""3 inches?

This time around I did not allow El Charro to mess up my order as I ordered the chicken elegante burro ($11.99).  The burro was stuffed full of chicken, avacado, bacon, onions, cheese and had chipotle ranch that added a little flavor and messiness that really made this burro.

""Very hip vibe. You order either a salad or stir fry meal via a touch screen monitor (just like at wawa, for those familiar). I like to build my own, but they have several standard options to pick as well. 

My only gripe is it was a bit light on meat. You can add more meat when ordering, but I would have liked a bit more with the regular order. Speaking of which, be careful when adding veggies on the build your own, after 3 you incur a $0.35 charge. Not a huge cost, but it can add up if you don't pay attention.

They have beer/cider to drink with dinner and also sell six packs to take home, something that helps them to stand out a bit.

1_nd9Hcswx4K4FmZZQPMVw,Rosemary's Grill,Langhorne,PA,5,"Rosemary's Grill is my favorite resaurant.  My wife and I take my Mother in law to Rosemary's Grill often for many reasons.  Their menu is extensive.  You can get Classic American food in many categories prepared fresh and delicious with great care and attention to detail that is lacking in common chain restaurants.  You can also get traditional Turkish cuisine that is the very best kebab that I ever had.  Rosemary's is a family owned business and they treat you like you are part of that family.  We are making Rosemary's our Saturday night place.  last weekend my wife and I took my. Mother in law to Rosemary's Grill for dinner.  It was even better that the time before.  I tried the Mixed grill kebab platter.  Lamb, Chicken, Adana, and gyro kebab meats, so tender and expertly spiced and grilled, along with a shepherds salad, grilled half tomatoes, rice, and of course flat bread.  The Adana kebab was particularly tender, juicy, and tasty.  I had never had Adana kebab before and will be ordering it again.  I shared a taste with my Mother in law and she loved it too!  mom in law had crab cakes and she enjoyed them very much.  My wife had the French onion soup, which she raves about and always orders.  She also had the roast turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and corn.  She loved everything on that platter.  She commented that the gravy was especially good.  The portion sizes are huge and we love to have the left overs again at home.  I have honestly not been to a restaurant in the area that has such good quality in all there entrees, sides, salad bar, and drinks, and you have to try the rice pudding.  We have eaten a few times here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and it continues to be our very favorite place.  The waitstaff and owners make you feel right at home and are warm, welcoming, and friendly.  I can not say enough good things.

WsFZqQ8X78nOVb9Lz4vcKA,Edmonton Craft Beer Festival,Edmonton,AB,4,"This is a really fun event for those who enjoy beer in all its forms. The drinks themselves were relatively cheap ($2-4 for a 4 oz. sample. Most were $2, some were $3, and very few were in the $4 range), however the food was really over priced ($6 for a small cup of fancy macaroni and cheese? really?). For the beer lover, however, there is a wide variety of tried and true along with the new kids on the block from local, national and international lines. Also, if you like what you tasted, you can buy it on site, with a Sobeys/Safeway liquor store right on site doing specials on the sampled brews. 

We went VIP for this event, however I don't think it's worth it. What you get: a glass mug instead of a plastic one, a beer and food class ($2 value) and a beer seminar ($2 value). If you do it all, or really value the glass mug, go for it! But for me, who just did the beer and food class, it wasn't worth it. 

My only complaint is for the venue, but for an event that size, you need the space. $16 for parking on top of your entry fee (though I guess most people would cab or Uber it there so you don't have to have a designated driver), and then you have to buy sample tickets on site.

At the least, it's fun stuff to look at.

Ultimately, I was very pleased. I find the whole process of shopping retail so frustrating, so that mostly accounts for the 4, and also the selection was more trendy that avant garde, perhaps... at the least, this place is one nice step forwards towards Nashville being a fashion-forward city.

rnioJAG4aQp2TJHUxLy7CQ,Pikpon Thai,Sicklerville,NJ,5,"Admittedly, I think of take out joints as less than ""real"" restaurants. In Pikpon's defense, they do have four tables, but it is primarily a take out. 

Pikpon has totally obliterated my feelings on take out places. Their food is excellent, not greasy and not salty. My fingers did not swell to the size of grapefruits like they do after nearly all other take outs--primarily Chinese and including pizza places.

We ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Shu Mai (steamed), Tom Yum Soup, Chicken Pad Thai, and Red Curry with Tofu. Nothing let us down. The Shu Mai was simultaneously dense and delicate, with a sauce that rivals any other dumpling sauce I've had. The Tom Yum Soup had the most potent of lemongrass, giving it an excellent Spring-like flavor. 

My partner cannot eat spicy food, so the Chicken Pad Thai was perfect. The noodles were done perfectly and the seasoning was perfect--you could really taste the crushed peanuts. We will be headed to Thailand later this year and I'm sure he will order this dish every chance he gets. 

My Tofu Red Curry was just the right level of heat, without burning your throat (or anything else)...just a nice spice in your mouth. The sauce was not really creamy, but nonetheless it could not have tasted any better. What was impressive was the firm and browned tofu. If I could make tofu like this, I'd probably make the leap to vegetarian because it was every bit as good--if not better--than any chicken dish I've ever had. What I also found best was it is not noodle based but bamboo shoots taking their place. I remarked to my partner that I could see using these as a vehicle for spaghetti gravy. So it was great to have such a tasty dish without the carb overload.

One of the reasons I consider take out subpar is because the texture changes in the take out containers. I'm unsure as to why we did not have this problem with Pikpon. I would say in my case, it could be because of the bamboo shoots replacing the noodles, but the Pad Thai had noodles and they did not become altered by the containers.

Thankfully, Pikpon is local to our residence. I can see becoming a regular visit here since the price is quite reasonable for the elevated level of their food. I had stopped eating Chinese food a while ago (mainly for health purposes), but I've missed it. Now I have a far superior alternative to that.",2018-05-21,POSITIVE,0.9955611228942871

Second, there were a lot more fries than sausage.  They were good fries, but made the sandwich seem even smaller by comparison.

When we got there, our table was almost ready so the hostess asked us to wait at the bar. We got a drink while we were waiting and the bartender happily transferred our tab to our table. They had a specialty house drink which my boyfriend and I both tried, it wasn't my taste but he loved it. There was a band playing that night, and our table was close by. The band was wonderful, played excellent jazz!
The food is served tapas style so it comes out as it's ready. We started with the fries, topped with feta cheese which were perfectly crispy and delicious. We got the bulgogi rice bowl which was flavorful but could have had a little more meat and vegetables to go with the rice. We were still hungry so we got an order of the mac & cheese and the bruschetta which were both phenomenal, I recommend getting each. After my house drink I had one of the beers, the fire ant, which was delicious. At the end of our meal the hostess came by to ask us if we minded moving to the sidebar table as they were behind on the reservations. It was a little offputting to be asked to move after spending $80 on a meal, but I understood and we happily moved. I read reviews that the servicehere was lacking and the bartenders were rude, but this was not our experience. The server was attentive, and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful in ordering and was happy to transfer our tab for us.

d_tRshM-w6S4QxE4VVi8tQ,Jones,Philadelphia,PA,4,"In my opinion, you cannot go wrong with good comfort food and Jones delivers.

I have been to Jones twice for dinner.  The most recent occasion was a Friday evening for my dad's birthday before seeing a play at the nearby Walnut Street Theater.  It was early-ish for a Friday (around 6pm) so we were seated right away.  I really like the atmosphere in Jones.  It's very open and the decor is fun, yet soothing.  I love the fireplaces.

My dad picked the wine so I've never looked at the list, but what he chose was good.  We ordered the pierogies as an appetizer and for my meal I had the Texas BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich.  Dessert was the peanut butter pie with some of the excellent homemade ice cream on the side.  I don't remember what my parents ordered but everything was delicious and everyone was happy with their meals.  Good sized portions although the app only came with four pierogies which wasn't enough for three people...but maybe that's just me because I love pierogies and could have finished the entire plate myself...

Our service was excellent.  She was very friendly and knowledgeable and helpful in making choices.

It's a pretty casual restaurant.  I'm sure on weekend evening especially you will see most patrons dressed nicely but my first time dining here was before a Phillies game in jeans and a sweatshirt and I didn't feel uncomfortable.

No, they didn't award Bill F. a pack of M&Ms and a water bottle to apologize for not having the room ready on check-in.  My room WAS ready when I arrived, and it included a Snickers bar and a water bottle.

The room had more power outlets than any hotel room that I've ever stayed in.  Truly an amazing thing; if you've read any of my other hotel reviews, you'll note that I'm frequently griping about such things.  My six-outlet power strip (which I *always* carry with me on trips) never came out of my suitcase while I was here.  Wow.

Parking is costly.  I don't have my bill in front of me, but I believe it was about $25 or $26 a day.

zVoxVPHEt11_0GzqNuT2ZQ,Home Wine Kitchen,Saint Louis,MO,1,"Three Dog Night had a popular song that hit number 1 on the charts in the 70's. It was appropriately called ""One"". In the lyrics, it stated, ""One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"". That may be true in love, but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do, avoid HWK. 

Not once, but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation, the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement, but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point, I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing. 

The second time, I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again, I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a ""limited menu"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window, she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said, ""no"".  I ate else where that day. 

What I do not understand, is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat, RL, The Pump Room, Table Fifty-Two, The Purple Pig, Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner, yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?

I understand they have a small space, but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar, let them order from the entire menu. Before posting, I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women, they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option.

quickly:
Crab cakes - tender and crumbly. They don't taste like ""crab"" which is what I prefer. The crab cakes come with a side of gianormos onion rings (i loved those).

clam chowder - pretty standard. it didn't blow your mind, but it also wasn't too ""fishy"" which can happen with clam chowder.

We saw everyone ordering crab and lobster, and we just salivated at the thought - we had dinner plans later that day so we couldn't try any of the big shellfish items. They definitely looked delicious!

some notes: 
-The indoor seating is limited. It's a small ""shack"" at the end of the pier. It was cold and windy the day we were there (yeah, can you believe it?) so there was more of a wait to sit inside.

This is a locals' favorite that serves outstanding seafood. Boiled crawfish -- amazing. Twist, suck, and pinch. Yeah you right!

Fried stuff is fantastic. We got fried pickles and fried calamari. You think fried calamari tastes like rubber? You'll change your mind here.

And not only is the food great, but the prices are sick. The crawfish were $2.99/lb. The specials board had mouthwatering complete dinners for $10.95.

For beer drinkers, they have interesting loca brews like Abita Satsuma (which I didn't find out about until we had finished our meal, goddamnit).

54NQk8KBYd8lMD3bLVbrAQ,Pep Boys,Warminster,PA,1,Scheduled an oil change on line. Chose the special they had advertised for 49.99 for their rewards customers. The oil change included up to 5 quarts of synthetic oil and oil filter. The only fine print on the page was about shop materials and extra time and costs for hybrid and electric vehicles. When I arrived I was told that since I have a Volvo it would be more expensive. I needed an extra quart of oil and the service writer said that the oil filter included with the special wouldn't work with my vehicle. Uhhhhh it said nothing about only one model of filter being used for the special. One model of oil filter? You should advertise that the oil change is only for one model of car. Now the oil filter my vehicle uses is just a cartridge. It has no metal housing like the standard spin ons used on most vehicle. Sooo its typically fairly inexpensive. He quoted me $90 for the service. Then after I laughed at him he said it would be $20 off making it $70. Which is still $20 more than it should have been. One extra quart of oil is not $20. I have spent a lot of money at this store in the past. I used to be a service writer here and continued to use this location after I left. I actually used to bring our fleet vehicles here. Now that none of the original techs are here and they chew through writers due to corporate decisions &policies  this store is terrible. I will no longer be spending my hard earned money here. I went to the dealer instead and spent $330 and was out under 2hrs and they washed the car for me. The oil change was only $60 but I had them do a few other things since I was here and leaving for the poconos for the weekend. So Pepboys lost more than an oil change by screwing around with their pricing.,2017-01-17,NEGATIVE,0.9994140863418579

N5QQdPac1cXwOHr-ePr90g,5th St. Bakehouse,Reno,NV,5,"Fantastic food, great prices, great service. 

You can really tell this is a small restaurant that offers food at low prices when the baked goods counter is nearly empty by 11AM. Face it people, they can't afford to throw away food at the end of day just to ensure they have everything available in the afternoon. You get the feeling that Chef Dan really cares for the restaurant, and does his best to ensure everything is top notch.  

I've been here over a dozen times, and only once had a merely acceptable meal, where I got some gristle in a pulled pork sandwich. I've had that sandwich 4-5 times so I attribute it to a bad batch of meat from the supplier. Every other meal has been excellent, from the huge omlette's, to the thick and delicious french toast, to the breakfast cuban... 

Servers are friendly, although there are times when all the tables are full that you may end up waiting a few more minutes, but it's well worth it. I only hope that they get more space someday, but it's great the way it is now... low overhead means we get great food at low prices. This is definitely a hidden Gem in Reno...

I went there yesterday with a girlfriend to order a drink while waiting on a friend. The bartender (Megan) was rude, unprofessional, and unpleasant. My friend ordered a French 45 and I ordered one of the ""Favorites"" the Pimm's Cup. 

We both disliked our drinks very much. I'm not sure what went wrong, but they just weren't very good. We let Megan know that we disliked the drinks and she says ""what's wrong them?"" We tell her that they both just taste bad. She then says ""well I made them the exact way the menu says"" 

Then she sticks a straw in one of the drinks and says ""that taste like it's suppose to"" Then she says ""since I already made the drinks, you'll have to pay for them"" 

This is completely unacceptable and poor customer service. If a guest orders anything that they dislike, the right thing to do is ask what would they like instead. I work in the restaurant industry and so does my friend who was with me. So we know true hospitality and what Megan said was the opposite.
I ask to speak with the manager. Megan tells me that the manager isn't in until 5pm (it's almost 2pm at this point)

Megan then says, ""I've worked here for 6 years so I know what I'm doing and what I'm talking about"" I then ask for the hotel manager. Megan says ""I'll get you something else and you just pay for the original two drinks that you disliked. 

Why on earth would we pay for the original two drinks in lieu of new ones? Why wouldn't she just comp the drinks, or void them, or separate them off for the manager to come later on? So I ask her those questions and she says she didn't have the authority to comp or void anything.

adb1hOYICrJ1Ix8M0sRpbw,Kuzina By Sofia,Cherry Hill,NJ,4,"I went back for dinner and was impressed again by the size of the portions.  There was live music performed on a Saturday night that was pleasant and upbeat.  

We shared the cold appetizer sampler (traditional hummus, eggplant and giant fava beans and dolmades - delicious and the dolmades are perfect) among 4 people, which was a good starter. 

I loved the special whole bronzino wrapped in grape leaves, but not as much as the whole dorado that I had at Kanella.

I did NOT love the grilled calamari, as it was probably too fresh from the sea for my taste.  I am not accustomed to this style.  I like mine cooked through and sliced in rings, rather than large, soft, tenderized whole pieces (there were 4).  This may be a traditional Greek style of grilled squid, but I wasn't open minded enough for its mushy texture.  

Personally, I thought the Horiatiki salad could have used more cucumbers and tomatoes and less green peppers and red onions, however it was refreshing and tasty all the same.  

Reservations for weekend dinners are probably a good idea: I was told that it was a ""slow night"" at Kuzina by Sofia because there was a famous Greek singer performing in AC that evening, yet there was but one table free at 7 PM!  

Though I enjoyed my  food from my first visit for lunch far better, Kuzina by Sofia still gets 4 stars from me for dinner based on the kind service, their welcoming accommodation to disabled persons, cleanliness, and the fact that Sofia smiled at me.",2009-05-26,POSITIVE,0.9994252920150757

6aoXAXNrL7KrGBVRYBMFWw,Andre Richard Salon,Philadelphia,PA,5,"I can't believe I've never written a review for Andre Richard Salon!  Andre has been doing my hair for a few years now, and he's the shizzle.  I live out in the 'burbs, but drive 45 minutes into the city every month to visit Andre because I won't let anyone else touch my head now.

My hair is a pain in the a** -- fine and curly, which means the wrong cut either leaves it weighed down and curl-less or looking like a frizzy mushroom.  I have had some cuts ove the years that have left me wanting to shave my head in frustration, so I am super picky.  Andre and his staff have had curly-hair mentoring with the DevaCurl folks, so they GET how to deal with curls.  My hair looks fantastic now, and I don't need to mess with it beyond washing it and throwing in some product.  No exaggeration, people stop me all the time and ask who does my hair.

Besides cuts and color, Andre and his staff are fantastic with dressier 'dos and makeup as well.  Andre has a performance background, and so he loves having fun with makeup and ""evening"" hair.  They provide styling services for a number of local fashion shows every year; I've been in the salon when it's been full of models getting made up before a show, and their work is superb.  Even with a short cut like mine, Andre has shown me little hints and tricks to funk it up a bit when I want a change.

If you're looking for a salon where people know their stuff, are fun to work with, and make sure you leave there looking awesome, you owe it to yourself to visit Andre Richard.",2011-10-28,NEGATIVE,0.9967606663703918
56q_auFAzhHK9Dvrs03AVA,Deviate Brewing,Indianapolis,IN,5,"I have to be honest, I was a little hesitant about this place simply because of its location. This area is surrounded by big box stores and chains so I thought it was strange that a brewery would pick this location. I tried it because my boyfriend's coworkers raved about the place and I sure am happy I did.

I stopped in here after a workout at the nearby LA fitness.  I went in with low expectations but came out with only smiles.  First off, the staff is very friendly. You can tell the bartenders highly respect the passion the owners put in their beer and they are a good face to the brewery.

We tried the flight of 8, all their beers on tap. They were very generous pours! I took my time sampling all their beers and took my rest in between sampling as a chance to look around the place. They let you bring in your own food! Not only that, but they have a list of places near by and their flyers available to you if you decide you need some carbs to soak up all the beer you have been drinking. They also have GIANT containers of pretzels to also soak up all the beer you have been drinking, for free. The nicest touch is the water jug in the corner. You can fill up your water to your hearts content without having to wait for a waitress to come by. I appreciate that more than they know.

The atmosphere is very laid back, huge tables to line up your pours on, and televisions to watch the game. Happy I decided to stop by. This is brewery that Indy will probably start to see a lot of.",2015-09-28,POSITIVE,0.9981498718261719

Go to Mortons, or Ruths Chris - they are predictable and live up to that.  

The Watermark, should reinvent itself, perhaps as 'space for lease', or live up to its facade

Do Nashville a favor, move.  Allow someone else to succeed at what the Watermark is not.

Or, deliver what one should naturally expect from the facade..

Either course would benefit Nashville.  

Ill explain, and I completely hope 'Hughes' the manager replies. 

Disappoint me, I wont care much, it happens.  

Disappoint my wife after I tell her I was assured - by the manager, Hughes  'its handled'? - this is what happens 

Actually, I spoke to him on the phone, asking for a small favor - my wife and her friend were celebrating her birthday early - could he please place a small candle or something in their dessert?  He found their reservation - 'no problem, Ill be happy too'   He made a comment along the lines of 'theres a note for the server..'   

Wrong.  My wife was mildly disappointed when there was no candle. Nothing crazy, didnt want a circus, just a candle.  

Although I took it on faith, since I spoke directly to the manager and from him - it was handled  'it was done'.     

I thought the matter was handled.  Wrong.  Something fairly trivial, fumbled.  I learned this after the fact..

Great non attention to detail.  Wonder if the kitchen staff uses soap to wash their hands..

Feel free to pull the ticket for the evening of the 23rd, table for two...7:30pm...

James the server, was 'very nice', no complaint - perhaps it is he who merited the additional star..

The hostess?  Rather Gothic.  Looked more a bartender than hostess.  

Overall, the menu is terrific. 

Too bad the entrees were lukewarm, and the soup (lobster bisque) was 'room temperature'.

kKPJLiHIr9Gd9sYs3GhxDQ,Brick & Mortar,Saint Petersburg,FL,2,"My fiance and I went here a couple months ago on a whim and were excited to try the food and experience what they had to offer. Sadly, not only were we not impressed with the food but we actually left hungry. I am not one to complain over the price of food or the portions if the food is exceptionally good. I've had very small portions of things that left me dreaming about it and wanting more and I will go back to those places to get it again. But this was not one of those experiences. We ordered a local seasonal picked vegetable plate with a rabbit pate. All the pickled veggies tasted the same, the rabbit was not that good. Very under seasoned and bland. We also had the onion and goat cheese tart with was literally the size of a round hostess snack cake. Super small. Ironically that was the only good thing we ate there. Next came our entree, which the waitress said would feed 2. It was 1, I repeat,  1 big ravioli with ricotta and egg in the middle over an oxtail ragu. The ravioli was under seasoned, the oxtail was over done and a bit tough and the sauce was one dimensional. It needed acidity or some heat. It's a cool looking restaurant with so much potential but just because you serve food and label it ""local"" or ""artisanal"" does not make it good. In my opinion this food is bland, pretentious, over priced and the portions are so tiny you will need to eat again directly after leaving.

Spq-2DVE8nilFhSFk0jLug,Tony B's Pizzeria,Fenton,MO,2,"Visited on a Saturday night. The place was packed, mostly families with kids and a few large groups. The ambiance is non-existent, just your average run-of-the-mill pizza place. When we arrived, we were instructed to sit wherever we wanted. 

First of all, the service was terrible. Only saw our waitress to give our order, get our food and beg for boxes/check when we finally did see her again. No one ever asked if we wanted drink refills, etc. The table wasn't even clean when we sat down. 

The food itself was ""meh."". I had the cannelloni which wasn't worth it. As someone else mentioned, the sauce is bland. Instead of having real mozzarella melted on top, it just had some processed shredded mozzarella. Plus I prefer cannelloni baked in a dish and this was just two noodles thrown on a plate. We also had a pizza, which wasn't terrible, but again as someone else mentioned, they clearly use canned mushrooms. I did see someone eating the pasta con broccoli and true to other reviews, it looked terrible. I couldn't even see sauce on it. 

I can see how this place is affordable and convenient for people with kids who aren't expecting a gourmet meal. As the pizza was not horrible and there are limited options in Fenton, I might return for carryout. But the service alone would keep me from dining in again. 

My suggestion would be to cut the number of entree and pasta options on the menu in half until they master those. The menu has too many options if they are all going to come out that poorly.",2012-03-04,NEGATIVE,0.9963833093643188

We went for breakfast rather than ""middle of the night drunk food post bar hopping down Broadway."" We arrived around 0930 on a weekday and it was packed, but we found the last 2 available seats. It's an interesting setup with the 3 ""sections"" it's divided into. 

I got the chicken and waffles and my boyfriend got the short rib hash. I was skeptical about the gravy with syrup on the waffle, but I went for it anyway. I was mostly impressed. The chicken and gravy needed a fair amount of salt/pepper, but the waffle was hot and not soggy. I asked for a little side of gravy because I felt like it didn't come with enough. Our waitress brought me a bowl and then promptly charged me $2.50 extra for it. I could've done without if I had known it was going to be that much. You're already paying tourist prices, so careful there.

He also served us some garlic bread that was a little more than toasted, meaning you bit into it and it disintegrated into dust. Oh well. It's only bread, right? No biggie. Our waiter returned and we placed our order. Garlic and Oil. Two Italian staples, right? Nope, not here. We placed your typical italian restaurant order.I got the eggplant parm and my husband got the veal parm. My husband ordered a side of aglio ed olio- garlic and oil spaghetti. The waiter was a bit confused, so my husband explained, ""You know, garlic, oil and butter sauteed, spaghetti thrown in?"" The waiter acted like he knew what we were talking about and then retreated to the kitchen. A few moments later, he came scurrying back to our table and told us that there would be a $.75 charge for the garlic and butter. Say what? We were a bit perplexed, but we took it in stride. A few minutes later he arrives back again with our dinner that did not in anyway resemble eggplant or veal parm or garlic and oil spaghetti. The eggplant was cut into spears, like pickles, unbreaded, and was thrown into sauce with cheese broiled over the top. The veal was a bit stranger- more of a scallopini sliced very thin, unbreaded with same cheese and sauce broiled over the top. The spaghetti arrived with a literal pat of butter on the top, sprinkled with garlic salt. Yup, no kidding, garlic salt. It was so salty that it was  unedible. My husband expressed his displeasure to the waiter, who scurried away yet again, never to return... Until it was time for the bill, of course. Hysterically enough, they removed the $.75 charge for the unedible spaghetti, but there was no other explanation or apology made for the really substandard food or the resulting lack of customer service. I don't know what these other folks are eating at Caruso's, but we did not enjoy our meal at all.",2013-08-18,POSITIVE,0.8932823538780212

It's eerie and grand, and lends the perfect note of spookiness to the atmosphere of the Bourbon Orleans--which alegedly has ghosts. It's old, after all, and in the French Quarter. I reckon it's not so easy to find an unhaunted hotel in these parts, the city that is called--among other things--the most haunted city in America.  New Orleans also has some of the best food, music, art and people anywhere. But back to the hotel, there is a certain just-past-its-prime grandeur to the decor. I liked it. My room was spacious, clean and quiet; it overlooked the lovely pool area, and had a comfy King size bed. The staff was friendly and quick. While the French Quarter was not particularly damaged by the hurricane, many New Orleans neighborhoods were--and are far from full recovery post-Katrina. So go there and see the city and enjoy the fun of the Quarter.

encfXG_jrG1M6gX1IqrHrw,Ballyhoo Grill,Tampa,FL,4,"This is good food.  I like great fish and this is a fine place to get it.  It's a casual place with fresh plates and prices are reasonable for fresh seafood.  The service is great.  I've been here twice.  

The 1st time almost a month ago, I had seafood gumbo $4, fish spread $8, and shrimp/scallop special ($20).  The fish spread is excellent but I don't love cooked salmon.  It's good and a lot of people would like this though so you should consider it.  The gumbo had an excellent taste & spiciness.  Mine was a bit thick but maybe that was a one-time thing.  The shrimp and scallops were just excellent.  They are what you seek.  I will be back to order them again.

2nd time, Sunday I was just there.  I had the fish spread again- and had forgotten about the salmon.  Think I'll get gumbo next time.  This time I had the catch, which was triple-tail snapper.  I took a picture- unfortunately didn't think of it until I'd taken my first bite- sorry.  The snapper was so good that I was sad when it was all gone, lol.

So why not 5 stars?  Only a picky topic for me.   It's the beer selection.  I had the space dust, which is a pretty good tasting sipper.  But it's not that drinkable (8% alcohol) and I like beer with my fish.  I prefer easy drinking IPA's and pale ales with dinner.  There isn't really another great choice on the menu, which is surprising, considering the better breweries nowadays.  There are 3 kinds of Amber ale amongst 8 taps total, lol.  Blue point, big storm, and v-twin are all good beers.  Maybe this is overkill?

I'd highly recommend any restaurant replacing the sorry goose island with Lagunitas Pale Ale or Lagunitas IPA.  Or, Green Bench Sunshine City.  or Deep South Citra, or Ballast Point Even Keel & BP Grunion, or Stone Tangerine, or even Cycle Crank IPA.  A very light, fruity, hoppy brew with lower alcohol would pair so much better with such great seafood.  Please consider so I can change this to 5 stars!",2017-06-06,POSITIVE,0.9995679259300232

The environment left us feeling as though we were at a  beach bar & restaurant. We tried two appetizers: Grilled Shrimp and Smoked Fish Spread. Both were well prepared and delicious. For entrees, Emily had the grilled snapper tacos and I had the gag grouper dinner. Both meals were delicious! The issues the exist can easily be corrected. It is summer and this is an outdoor venue. You order your food at a hut located behind the bar. However, you have to stand in the HOT sun while ordering! A canopy needs to be installed. There is no pricing listed anywhere so you order and then get surprised by what you are asked to pay. What we ordered was well worth what we paid but it would be nice to know what you are spending before you order. The only menu is a series of high-end cocktails all of which sound delicious. However, the bartenders are not adept and creating these wonderful concoctions. So the delivery is not as great as the written word. Suggestion, cocktail napkins or coasters (they won't blow away) and ice. Alcohol melts the ice so load the glass up because the Florida summer heat melts the ice also. The plastic wear is fine and works well enough but the little piece of paper in the package is not sufficient to be called a napkin. Serve and extra ""real"" napkin with the utensils. One thing for sure we will be back but at this price point, a few additional steps need to be taken by management and crew.

Went twice on one night so I was able to experience two aspects of the place. The first time was pre-game for an event we had at the Laurel Hill Cemetery. We stood at the bar. The bar itself is very small and I felt like I was crowding the people sitting at the high top table behind me. The bartender was very nice but could have used more knowledge of the beer selection. They didn't seem to know much about the style of the beer. 

The second time was after the event. We were running late and I called to let them know (we had reservations at 9) and they were very pleasant and accommodating. When we arrived we sat at a table. One of the first things you notice is the pizza oven with Pizza's constantly going in and out of it. So we had to order pizza and really it's the only thing I've ordered and all I can say is fantastic.  We split two pizza's and took the rest home. We got the Marcherita pizza with white anchovy. The anchovies weren't your typical little salty fish, no, they were large semi-salty fish and the pizza was delicious.

Everything I tasted had flavor and it seemed cooked very well.  Even dishes that are the american staples tasted better here than I've had at other places.

On my plate there was palak paneer (very delicious), a samosa, some sort of vegetable ball in a curry sauce and, of course, the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala.  I liked it all.  The masala, which I'm not normally a fan of had a surprising amount of flavor.  The palak paneer still had some of its green characteristic and had a little tang to it.

Their selection is truly outstanding. You have your choice of patties, cheeses, toppings and condiments to build whatever burger your heart desires. I believe there are some suggestions as well if you're not feeling particularly creative that day. 

The last time we were there, my boyfriend got the Kobe beef burger, thick cut applewood smoked bacon, a fried egg and Vermont cheddar cheese. He was knocked to the floor, and has been telling everyone about it ever since. I got a simple beef patty with cheese and BBQ sauce. Maybe I need to be a bit more adventurous next time! Nonetheless, I still loved my burger.

Another great thing about 500 Degrees is the option to get your fries with truffle oil. It's just a little extra flavor added to already spectacular crispy French fries. 

I've always had stellar service here. I loved joking around with the woman who served us last time about coming through hell and high water for an as yet undetermined burger since we had come in out of a torrential downpour and it took me 10 minutes to decide what I wanted off of the menu. I blame it on the rain brain.

My only gripe about 500 Degrees is that it can get a little pricey. For burgers, fries and drinks for 2, we paid about $28.

KUYGwEEEM8yFkCf-CxpRPQ,Singha Thai Cafe,New Orleans,LA,3,"I'm not about to say that Singha is among the best Thai restaurants, but if you are looking for tasty, inexpensive food in the CBD and have tired of po boys or ""hot plate lunches"", you could do much worse than to pop into this deceptively large little cafe.
    I don't mean to damn with faint praise-Singha is good, and if the food (the very inexpensive lunch specials in particular) is mostly watered down warhorses of the American-Thai repertoire, that owes more to their desire to stay in business, catering to the mobs of less adventurous office drones that spill out of the surrounding high rises every weekday between 11:30 & 1:00 like clockwork.
      The calamari appetizer is perfectly fried and i have a very warm place in my heart for the Carondelet shrimp. Otherwise, just order what you usually do at your fave Thai joint and ask for more chili paste if you need a more authentic kick.",2011-12-02,POSITIVE,0.9928995370864868
SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,Santa Barbara,CA,5,"This review is mostly about my friends' dishes and the general impressions I got more so than my own personal taste.

So for starters - I ordered the lobster roll. The dish was not to my liking, but that's because I'm not a fan of celery in lobster rolls. The celery was diced but it was too much and it overpowered the dish. I also found the lobster overdressed. But some of this is just a matter of taste so I won't ding them hard for that.

The rest of the food, given the price, was fantastic. The crab and lobster were all fresh, all cooked correctly, and all at a price that worked. 

It is rare to find a seafood restaurant these days that is reasonably priced and one that serves fresh good seafood. Most are either way too expensive or way too sucky. This is not one of them.",2018-05-29,NEGATIVE,0.9830854535102844

While the food was good, it wasn't great. My steak seemed not to have any seasoning and was unevenly cooked. Medium on one half while more rare on the other. They talk about the smoky flavor but I thought my wife's lamb looked a bit black. Her seasoned potatoes were OK but she thought the risotto was just so-so. My spinach and potatoes were very good but the mushrooms were nothing to talk about.

We also ordered tomato and mozarella salads and were good.

Being a bride from Houston, TX I hired a Santa Barbara local planner in hopes that they could connect me with some great local vendors. She did not disappoint!!! 
I barely know where to begin in terms of how amazing she is. I honestly was lost (in the wedding planing process) before her!  By the time I found her we were already a little less than a year from the wedding date so from day ONE we hit the ground running! Krystal was so communicative, so cooperative, so patient, so helpful, so reassuring, I mean the list goes on and on. If I wasn't 100% sure or happy with the vendors she initially recommended, she would always have an option that was exactly what I was looking for. She knew my vision before even having to fully explain it - she is that good! 
In terms of day of (wedding was March 31, 2018- so this is still relatively fresh), everything ran extremely smoothly. I mean if there were any issues at all, I didn't even know about them. Krystal checked in on us girls getting ready maybe once or twice just to see if we needed anything or how things were coming along and that was really it! Otherwise we were left to completely enjoy ourselves! I was getting a little worried as we got closer to the ceremony time because we were running a little behind while getting ready, but Krystal was so calming and reassuring that everything will still run smoothly so I was not stressed about making it exactly to my timeline! 
After the ceremony, Krystal had drinks in hand, ready for us, while taking photos. She made sure we got some of our passed appetizers that were going around during our cocktail hour, and she made sure we actually got some food and ate! The rest of the night was just perfect. The DJ, DJ Hectik - someone highly recommended by Krystal, kept everyone on the dance floor the remainder of the night! 
Literally that day was my dream come true. Couldn't have been better. I'm gonna miss Krystal! It was amazing getting to work with her and I would do it again in a heartbeat!",2018-04-17,POSITIVE,0.989856481552124

A crazy combination that works very, very well. Thankfully my friend couldn't eat all his pasta and let me take it home with my Osso Bucco. Both dishes made one heck of breakfast.

uE40984_YDgVvPeRpFcCaQ,The Fat Ham,Philadelphia,PA,2,"The food at Fat Ham isn't bad, it's just incredibly overpriced. To account for small portions and exorbitant prices they say that they're ""tapas"" style. It's literally just an excuse to charge a lot for small portions of basic food. As a Philadelphia ""Southern"" restaurant I was somewhat disgruntled by their adoption of Spanish tapas style. 

Anyway, I came here with a friend on a Friday and we ordered the skillet cornbread (8), oyster slider (6 each), mac and cheese (8), and hot chicken (15). It came out to about 50 dollars with tax and tip, which I found ridiculous for the amount and type of food  (we were both still hungry after). 

Cornbread: The cornbread looks a lot bigger in the pictures than it actually is. It's about 3x4 inches, or about the size of an iphone 6. I get paying a lot for appetizers when there are a lot of fresh ingredients or it takes a lot of prep time, but this is literally a piece of cornbread....8 dollars for mixing margarine, cornmeal, eggs, a few other dry ingredients (probably in bulk), and then throwing it in the oven. 

Oyster Slider: Crispy fried oysters with slaw. It was good, but again, tiny as hell. You'll eat it in two bites. 

Mac and Cheese: For a southern place it was way below par (...also, wait for it.....incredibly small). Under-salted and underwhelming 

Hot Chicken: Two pieces of spicy chicken on ranch, cucumber, and white bread (just straight up square white bread from the store). The chicken was pretty good but nothing to run over there for. 

I know that there isn't a lot of southern food in Philly, but if you're looking for a fix, this probably isn't where you want to come.",2016-01-17,NEGATIVE,0.9974644184112549

Silver in the city is always my go to first. They are always on top of the newest ""it"" items for your home and style. They also allow dogs in their store so that's a huge plus because I'm typically walking my dog when I stop in. 

The only reason I am not giving them five stars is that although their employees are super friendly, they definitely watch you. I understand the need for this because they have little items that probably get stolen a lot but I always feel like I have no privacy to browse and debate any purchases.

F2T2Ef5kcZuyTyUcJyh0rQ,Timeout Sports Pub & Restaurant,Boise,ID,2,"I've been driving by this location for several weeks anticipating their opening.  With the established Legends Sports Bar directly across the street I thought this place must have something very special to feel they can compete.

They took over the building that was prevriously used by the Ruby River Steakhouse.  The owners apparently opted not to change a thing about the indoor seating.  Gone are all the cowboy boots, up are various team jerseys. It looks like somebody went to Pro Image at the mall to decorate the place.  Nothing appears to be autographed or evoke a sense of authenticity.

Video games are available for the kids, so bring your quarters.  No dart boards, shuffleboard, air hockey or pool tables.  This is pretty much a dine and drink only establishment.

More TV's in the place than I could count (I figure at least 20), all tuned to ESPN or ESPN2.  No clue at this time if they are choosing to use Direct TV, Dish, or Cable One for their service.  However, they already have made one of the biggest mistakes I think most wannabe sports bars make; they broadcast music rather than sound from a live sporting event.  With live sporting events available almost everyday from 12pm - 12am, you would think they would want to try to emphasize that rather than muzak (tuned to a country station; still feels like the Ruby River).

A word of advice here, if you want people to stay and eat and drink, you gotta give them something on which to focus their attention.  The sounds of the game will get their attention.  They came to a sports bar to think about sports, not Conway Twitty.

Typically, when I see the word pub in a restaurant name, I think it is just beer and wine, but it looks like Timeout has a full bar with several specialty drinks.  With a designated driver, it may be fun to experiment.

The food is typical sports bar fare; salads, burgers, pasta.  Most items will cost $9 - $11, with entrees running more.  A few twists on their offerings will ensure that I stop in to try something different, but unless the atmosphere improves, I think I will always leave a little disappointed. 

Those staying at the nearby motel may like the proximity, but I think they might find the walk across the street to Legends worth the extra steps.

I understand that the winery has more than one lable and other label is their premium wines.  I look forward to when that is available (I went two weeks ago so maybe it already is)     Location..   what's not to like?  On the pier!  A wonderful outdoor patio,  couldn't have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting....   The staff were super, super nice,  I would give them an A+!  

So why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn't even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   

So go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.   But avoid the wine club!  For that you can pretty much go to any of the other wine tasting rooms on the Urban wine trail.",2011-08-25,POSITIVE,0.9824199676513672

First things first, I heard this place used to be a nightclub, but they did such a good job re-facing it, you'd never know. I was a little shocked to see white tablecloths and such a ""fancy"" feeling setting considering this is a really affordable lunch or dinner (and takeout) option. But, I appreciate the effort and slightly strange branding of everything (I'm talking from the napkins to the glasses). But you know what? Go ahead and rep yourself! 

Our group hardly ever eats Indian, so this was a gamble for sure, but we played our cards right! They've got EVERY possible Indian dish you could want. After taking nearly half an hour to decide what we wanted, we went for some basics like Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma (de-lish!) but tried some new things as well. Our takeaway? Next time, more spice please. They were probably too nervous to really take it to a medium, so we all felt like our food was more of a mild. I think they are very mindful of their customers, which is nice. 

The staff and manager were incredibly helpful, especially considering my bf's dairy and nut allergies. We didn't realize it, but Indian food has A LOT of dairy and nuts! (who knew?) They did ultimately cook him up a special order of chicken curry that he really liked. 

The consensus: We WILL come back to try the lunch buffet so we can sample everything and educate ourselves on the different varieties and flavors of Indian food. 

Tip for you: They seem to have a big carryout/takeout business and the joint didn't really start getting busy until around 9pm. 

Tip for the biz: Yes, we loved guessing the piano versions of top 40 songs (super jazzy) but we really preferred it when some Indian music came on! Play more of that, please.",2017-06-19,POSITIVE,0.9959816932678223

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,Santa Barbara,CA,4,"One of the best road trip stops, bar none!

A great place to mingle with the locals and take in the great music and festive ambiance. Now let's get this straight, this is no high end fancy santa barbara bar, so if that's what you're looking for then you've best turn back. This is a nitty gritty, authentic, cabin bar in the middle of the woods; with a mixed crowd of bikers, campers, musicians, and local patrons. Overall this is a great watering hole to sit and enjoy the music, ambiance and grab a drink or two before heading on your way. 

When people say ""off the beaten path"" this is what they are talking about. It's like stepping back in time or maybe even side stepping to a more rural state because a place like this is rare in California.   

During holiday weekends, this place can get packed so be prepared to wait a bit for a beer. This place is more of an Oasis than anything else. A little slice of country in order to escape the monotony of city life. 

I would recommend checking the website to find the talented bands that frequent this establishment. For the most part the bands play on Fridays from 7-10pm, Saturdays 2-5pm & 6-9pm, and Sundays 1:15-4pm & 4:30-7:30pm.

I3nzb6O33IDZ6tp3Er0iIA,Reno Events Center,Reno,NV,3,"Two years ago Florida Georgia Line came to town right around my birthday. Radio, TV and all over social media, all I saw was the concert. I figured it was impossible to not know about it, and I also figured my wife would be taking us to see the show for my birthday surprise. Sadly, I was wrong, and the show came and went, leaving me waiting for another opportunity to catch these guys live.

Finally, that day came, and I took matters into my own hands this time! I scored a pre-sale code and bought two great seats, only to find out my wife would be out of town the night of the show. Lucky for me I had a great friend decide to join me for the show, and what a show it was! 

In addition to the sweet sounds of Cadillac 3 and Cole Swindell, who played all the hits, Florida Georgia Line brought the energy, the stage game, and every one of the songs you wanted to hear. But the best part had to be the two incredible surprises! In the second half of the show they walked down a catwalk to a second stage at the rear of the auditorium and played a set with Cole Swindell and Cadillac 3, including some homages to their country mentors, like ""Back At Mama's"" by Tim McGraw! This was trumped only by the encore, when they talked about the songs they identified with as kids and then performed them! Songs like Montell Jordan's ""This is how we do it"", Backstreet Boys ""Everybody"", Alan Jackson's ""Should Been A Cowboy"" and Papa Roach ""Last Resort"", and then they closed it all up with ""Cruise"".

3 Stars because of the insanely long wait for a bar. I think that's a shame. It's an event center. They should know how to do this by now. 

Otherwise the place is great. Solid sound, comfortable seats and clean.",2016-10-01,POSITIVE,0.978307843208313

TCHh4RIrvp7h2BucXt1kvA,Snap Custom Pizza,Ardmore,PA,3,"When I found this place on Buzzfeed, I was excited to try it since its close to where I live. Upon  arriving it was packed due to a charity thing with a local sorority. My friend and I were ok waiting for the line. Everyone seemed so friendly, but I quickly learned it was just a facade. I ordered two pizzas as  I was pretty hungry. A margarita and a custom. My custom pizza was to die for. I could eat it again and again. The margarita was not quite up to par. I asked for extra basil and got maybe 4-5 leafs. It had zero flavor and was pretty disappointing. I felt as if they rushed me through the line. I told one guy about the ""finishing touches"" and then the girl who was to do it, ignored him and didn't do it.. Mind you this was after she took her extra long hair out of her pony tail re fixed her hair and put it back up all while on the line. As a chef, I was disgusted, but didn't want to be rude as I felt i was too far into the process to turn back now. The employees seemed pretty happy but almost robot like. Not wanting to laugh or joke back. When I asked a question they seemed annoyed to answer. I brought wine as they told me they were BYOB. ALL of the wine glasses were pretty nasty and gross. I had to rewash mine when I got outside to my seat. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our meal outside. She went in to get me a box and  I put the leftovers of my two pizzas on one platter while I waited. An employee came out to throw out the trash. He made slight friendly conversation and promptly asked me to hold my pizza while i waited because he wanted to take my board inside now instead of coming back out for it. It was 6pm. The night wasn't even close to being over. And I would have been happy to return it. I found it completely rude that I had to hold my greasy, hot pizza while  I waited for my friend to bring me a box because the gentleman didn't want to come back later to clean up the board. It rubbed me the wrong way. 
The layout of the place was a bit over congested. Trying to go back to the bathroom, you had to fight your way through the customers who were waiting to be waited on to get there. And college kids are not the friendliest. 
Overall Im giving 3 stars because of the staff and the lack of flavor in such a simple pizza. I don't think I will be going out of my way again to visit the place.",2016-09-21,NEGATIVE,0.9965476393699646

F2C5ENuY8CXfgoW-gAMdDA,Revolucion,Indianapolis,IN,3,"I'm trying to decide how I feel about this place, and I suppose I wish I had a more nuanced star system wherein I could give half-stars. It's not quite 4-stars in my mind, but it's also above par. I think I'm going to settle on a 3-star, because the ""A-OK"" in my mind means more than simply saying, ""It was okay,"" but instead giving a relatively emphatic thumb up while saying, ""It was A-OK."" 

That's about right. It's a good atmosphere, they have a decent bourbon selection along with their beers and tequila, and the pork tacos were fantastic with the cilantro and a good squeeze of lime. The corn tortillas weren't quite formidable enough to contain their insides, but that may be simply not knowing the power that exists in these meat hooks of mine. 

What really disappointed me, and killed the possible 4-star rating were their ""frites."" Calling French fries ""frites"" implies a certain level of potato artistry is involved in their preparation. What came to the table were just standard frozen French fries, seemingly of the Ore-Ida variety. Ore-Ida is the Thomas Kinkade of potato artistry. When you are expecting Dali, and you get Kinkade, the establishment loses a star.

Anyway. I doused the fries in ketchup, rounded an Elijah Craig, and Bob's your uncle. Down the hatch with 3-stars and the possibility of an updated review in the future with another star now that I know what to steer clear of on the menu.",2012-05-30,POSITIVE,0.998021125793457

The ambiance is nice and pretty formal-ish. At least for dinner, it's one of those places you could feel comfortable dressing up pretty well or coming in with jeans and a decent shirt.

You don't get super massive portions: my husband and I shared two main dishes and only had a little bit left. But I thought it was a good price. Their menu is online if you Google it.

I've eaten Indian in a fair number of different places - homemade and in restaurants - and was happy with this place. It certainly isn't the best I've had, but it's better than OK. I'd recommend it, and I'll go back with friends.",2012-04-01,POSITIVE,0.9992440938949585

We got an email the night before with directions on where to meet, contact information, and how to identify her.  She was an excellent guide, full of interesting facts (Ben Franklin and tofu? who knew!) and her knowledge of the area and the history was most impressive.  She could answer the architecture student asking about window styles, the folks with obscure questions about who did what when, and knew the proper and little known term for the type of cobblestone used in the area.  Her anecdotes were so interesting and amusing, and brought an aliveness to the tour that was just fantastic. The pace was well set, she didn't lose a single person during the crossings (which is not so easy) and she had a clear speaking voice, easy manner, and great sense of humour.

Upon entering we were yelled at to shut the door (we were literally just crossing the threshold when the waiter snapped at us) and then he took menus and literally threw them on a table and walked away. We waited for over 10 minutes before anyone ever greeted the table and the only reason anyone ever came was because I had to flag down another server when she walked passed us (and another table who had been seated just before us who also had no server) to greet a table who just walked in. Our server was the same guy who yelled at us earlier and when I suggested to my sister that she order her food with her drink he said ""yeah lets just get this all over with at once"". The burger was disgusting, it looked like a McDonalds hamburger but greasier. I just got coffee so I can't say I tasted it but if it had been served to me I would have returned it. I had to flag the server down for the check and when I put my card out to be taken (everyone else was paying in cash) he walked by literally six times without taking the card. I ended up just paying cash. I have served my entire college career so I understand what the job is like but to be blatantly hostile is something I will never understand. Yes, we are tourists just like probably 90% of the restaurant (it was Sugar bowl weekend so the team colors gave it away) but that is no excuse to treat people so poorly.

BxveuvYElRjEIuVNiJAEtA,Best in the West Nugget Rib Cook-Off,Sparks,NV,5,"Arrived early at 10:30AM and found the best parking spot possible.  Right near the arts and crafts and not smashed between any other cars.  I was planning for a loooong walk, but luckily was less than a block away.

We hit up the Arts and Crafts first and I was impressed by the selection.  Lots of snacks (nuts, popcorn, sauces, candy, etc.), clothing, toys, decorations, etc.  I ended up buying a dutch oven pot, Angry Bird keychains and popcorn.  I could have gone crazy, but I resisted the urge!

We ate at the Checkered Pig first and had the Rib Sampler and 1/2 a dozen of Hush Puppies.  Loooove the sauce!  Great taste and doesn't taste store bought like some of the other ones did.  I'm actually planning on going back to buy the sauce.  And the Hush Puppies ... what can I say?  Pretty good flavor, but really though ... how can you go wrong with Hush Puppies?!

We also stopped by the Carson City rib booth and tried their Rib Sampler as well as a Chicken Kabob.  I was slightly disappointed with their sauce.  The ribs were tender and chicken was cooked good, but in my opinion, I think their sauce tasted store bought.  I apologize in advance because I'm sure there's some Carson City rib lovers on here that have now put a hit out on me.

Lastly, we ended up getting Fried Mushrooms and a Strawberry Funnel Cake.  Fried Mushrooms didn't have much flavor and they were what they were.  Just battered mushrooms deep fried.  At least we tried them, but we had high hopes and were slightly disappointed.  The Strawberry Funnel Cake was super filling!  It was cooked perfectly ... it was fresh and just crunchy enough.  

We also scored some ""official gear"" for this cook off with a mens t-shirt, pig beaded necklace and a rib cook offf pin.  We drove to Reno for this event, might as well remember it!

Overall, we loooved this festival.  Everyone would always talk about it and we fiiinally made it out.  I'm pretty impressed and now would like to see what the next years cook off will bring.  On that note, we're going back tomorrow to hit up some other booths we wanted to try but had no room in our bellys.

Helpful tip:  Bring an umbrella for shade when you walk/wait in lines and a chair to sit on.  Seating seemed to be very limited so racing for a seat once someone gets up is never fun.  Ribs and sides are hard to eat!  I'm surprised they didn't offer more tables/chairs.  That's the only downside.  Free event = can't complain.",2011-09-02,POSITIVE,0.9945224523544312

What I like about Steve is that I don't think he tries to sell me stuff I don't need (for example, the dealer told me I was a good candidate for some sort of fuel system flush...I called Steve and he said I didn't need it with my low mileage. He easily could have gone along with it and taken my money, but he didn't). Bottom line - I trust him.

I ordered the salmon bibimbap with my rice on the side. I thought the flavors balanced perfectly. Compared to other bibimbaps I've had in the past, the one I had at Southgate wasn't too heavy on the sauce. The ingredients were also seasoned just right, so that the main star of the dish was the actual salmon. While I don't drink, I was also extremely impressed by their drink specials.

The restaurant was crowded but we got seated quickly at the bar. We ordered some beers, BBQ chicken wings (Recommended!) and french fries. I ordered a Sanza Margarita as well after seeing it was on the Happy Hour menu (Happy Hours: 3-5 pm and 8-10 pm!). For $4, I had a huge margarita, which was unexpected. The service, however, was lacking. I was sitting right across from the bartender and I had to ask him for napkins, utensils, and another beer. He didn't pay attention to his customers at all. 

I recommend coming to the bar when you want to catch a movie. The drinks are good and the happy hour menu is awesome. I've rarely seen any restaurant offer happy hour at 8-10pm. Gotta love it!

I just moved to the area and was in desperate need of a bang trim. I paid a visit to Emily so I could see again and loooooved it. The price was a little high ($12 for a bang trim), but ah well. I'm used to high prices - I just moved from LA. 

The salon is modern and fun. They carry wonderful products (Bumble and Bumble, OPI, etc.) and the staff always smiles and says hello - even if they're not your stylist.  The stylists don't push product on you after your appointment either AND you can earn salon ""bucks"" for referring friends.

One time they were perfection, served with a spicy dip; another time they were cold and greasy business. The cheese fries were incredible. Bacon, chili, and more of the spicy dip. The pineapple fritters had amazing ingredients....and were served a tad bit burned. I really liked the Midwest BLT (Fried green tomatoes on a sandwich, awesome.) One of my favorite sandwiches in the Tampa Bay area is the Rib and Mac. Oh. So. Good! The Fried Oreo Sundae is a decadent end to any American meal.
 EATS! also offers a pretty solid burger on Mondays for $5. You can add toppings for a little extra $. I added chili and cheese, yum! Heads up, you may not use a Groupon in conjunction with this burger offer.

g3LweOTJlJoALtaShN4SLA,Barrel 55,Meridian,ID,4,"My husband and I were headed to Chili's, when we noticed that Barrel 55 had just opened, so we decided to give the new place a try. The interior of the restaurant has been transformed from a Mexican restaurant. It was well lit, and quite comfortable. We were their first customers of the day, so no waiting, we were shown directly to a table. We couldn't have asked for better service! Every need we had was met almost before we knew we needed it! 

The menu is a little limited, but we found plenty of dishes that sounded great. We finally settled on the beer cheese fondu and the prime rib sandwich with fries to share between the two of us. The fondu was delicious, served with cubes of bread and roasted Brussel sprouts. The good stout cheese held up to the Brussel sprouts, and was very flavorful. The sandwich was very good, moist flavorful thinly sliced prime rib, covered with caramelized onions and au jus for dipping. I thought the flavor was very good, but the little condiment cup of au jus was way to small to try to dip the sandwich in. We suggested they look at a different container for their au jus. But the fries were wonderful! I don't eat fries often, so I consider them a treat! Barrel 55's fries are real potatoes, well seasoned and cooked just right! My only disappointment was they didn't offer fry sauce to go with them! Our server immediately promised to go make some for me, but alas...the kitchen didn't have any mayo. I'm not sure how they prepare a burger without mayo, but I'm sure I'll find out eventually! 

I have to say, we definitely enjoyed our meal and will go back for the prime rib sandwich, I loved those caramelized onions! Our iced tea glasses never ran dry, and our server was attentive, but not annoying. 

I suggest you give Barrel 55 a try, I hope it will be successful and be around for a long time! It is a welcome change from the big chain restaurants.",2016-07-04,POSITIVE,0.9989227652549744

The cafe sells bubble tea (boba), Halo-Halo (Filipino shaved ice drinks), Filipino coffee, Filipino baked goods, smoothies, and more. Things on the menu are fairly prices and the cafe itself has a modern feel to it. 

I enjoyed a Halo-Halo Supreme yesterday ($5) and it was excellent. All the ingredients tasted fresh and my Filipino friends were definitely enjoying it as well (and coaching me on tips for mixing everything together for the best flavor). The Halo-Halo has flan in it which is awesome and shows the roots of Filipino cuisine in Spain. 

We also tried the Ensaymada Ube Bread (~$3) which was excellent. It is a baked dessert that is stuffed with Ube (purple yam) which is perfectly sweetened. The bread itself was soft and enjoyable and could also pair well with some coffee. 

The location is next to the original Saigon Deli on Waters and Dale Mabry behind the La Quinta hotel. It's hidden from the road so you should look for the Saigon Deli sign.

I would agree with some of the reviews and say that the nigiri isn't the best. I suppose a lot of this is dependent on how recent the fish delivery was, but I went for my standard array of nigiri: hamachi (disappointing), scallops (disappointing), salmon (even more disappointing), albacore (yum), uzura (super yum), and unagi (super yum). So I guess if you look at it, it was an even split of great and crap. So the 4 stars is definitely coming from rolls and the service. The rolls were made quick and held together well, the wait staff was so on it, I was almost put off as to how many times I was checked on. The mussels were really good, what helps is that they don't go overboard with the mayo, big plus in my book, plus they do theirs similar to kitzmo, with a little ponzu flavor in it that is a nice addition, I might ask them to add a jalapeno on top next time. Loved the volcano roll with the tempura'd green onion inside and the tempura veggie roll with yam, zukes, carrots, and topped with avocado. Best veggie roll I've ever had.

My breakfast sandwich hit the spot (bacon egg and cheese on a blueberry bagel), but my boyfriend's hash brown was mushy. Service was average and the line was confusing for someone who has never been here before. The line starts to the right of the counter.

SKgD0jRWVKk3NqOtSs3VFA,Jerry Bob's On Broadway,Tucson,AZ,5,"I would use all the ink in Yelps pen to compliment this establishment.  This is a perfect example of price balance, speedy / accurate / polite service, hard working cooks, cleaner silverware than Sam Witches and Such, and good food.

The special for under $3 M-F is 2 eggs with your choice of hashbrowns and toast or a list of other sides.  I've tried this with grits, hashbrowns, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, white toast, and bacon - all are absolutely perfectly cooked and served to you in less than 5 minutes.

These are the fastest cooks I've seen.

The waitresses are fast and polite, not overbearing.  This brings me to a delicate situation:

I ALWAYS TIP THEM MORE THAN 40% AND I RECOMMEND YOU DO TO.

Allow me to explain:  I happily tip just over 20% at Sullivans and Flemmings, even with a bottle of Symmetry by Rodney Strong, when the service is good.  I tip over 20% when the service is good at any restaurant.  If I tip 20% here, the waitress get 60 cents = no bueno.  She runs around for a heck of a lot more than that.  (In fact, I donate 60 cents every day to a child in another country that I don't even know).  

So, I usually tip between 50 - 100% of the check here, and I implore you - if they give you good service, consider it please.

Back to the review...A+++ on Ebay, thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert and 5 Stars on Yelp.  Check them out if you haven't, impossible to top for breakfast.",2013-10-03,POSITIVE,0.9995493292808533
RCKbAKRkm-kOPcx8hqJrtg,Dobbs Tire And Auto Center,Brentwood,MO,1,"What a crock.  My wife and I had two vehicles in need of safety and emission checks.  I, the husband, dropped my vehicle off for the emission check around 9:15am and was told that it would take around an hour.  No big deal.  My wife pulled in 30 minutes later and went in (I had already walked to a nearby store).  They told her they could not guarantee a time for the safety and emission check, but that it should be done by 5:00.  My vehicle was done within 30 minutes, and my wife's wasn't completed until around 3:30.  Now, maybe the safety check does take a bit longer- so that's fine.  That said, they said that her vehicle needed a new brake light and that one of the windshield wiper blades needed to be replaced in order to pass the safety inspection.  They quoted her $250.00 for the repairs.  TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS.  I went to an auto parts store and bought the necessary bulbs and a wiper blade for a grand total of $37.89.  They told my wife the bulbs were LED- they aren't.  They were going to replace an entire tail light assembly when all that needed to be replaced were three bulbs.  Now, the kicker.  When I took the tail light assembly out to do the (easy) replacement- three of the five bulbs had been unsocketed and pushed back into the lens.  One bulb had been cracked.  Now, I have no proof that the tail light was functioning before.  But I have considerable doubts that the bulbs had been pushed in and broken before I dropped this thing off at Dobbs.

Long story short, this place will get the job done.  They'll just gladly charge you about SEVEN TIMES the cost of the actual repair.  Unbelievable.  Any reputable repair shop would never quote such an astronomical price for such easy and quick repairs.  I will NOT be returning.",2016-08-27,NEGATIVE,0.9993878602981567

W5tIz4sl1yRW_fOXHoGVzQ,barre3 Nashville - The Gulch,Nashville,TN,5,"I just recently moved to the Nashville area. Much like other people have expressed, I was weary about any type of Barre class; I didn't like the whole ""stigma"" that went along with it. My workouts have always consisted of kickboxing and weight lifting. A couple months ago I hurt my shoulder weight lifting and the PT told me to avoid anything to do with weights/pull-ups etc for months until it healed. After having two knee surgeries this year, I didn't want to push my luck hurting my body any further. I decided to join Barre and see what it was all about since it seemed to be low impact. I wasn't really expecting a lot going into it as I didn't possibly see how doing pilates/ballets moves could actually give me a good work out. 15 minutes into the first class I was greatly humbled. I was fatiguing parts of my body that hadn't been worked in years, I never imagined those ""tiny"" movements would have such a huge impact. I've been going to Barre for a couple months now, and it does not get easier. Oddly enough, the more you go the harder it becomes. You learn how to really dig deep and and push yourself to the edge. It took me awhile to consciously remember to keep my belly button tucked to my spine and my hips squared, but this makes such a huge difference in your results. I'm constantly on the go and these 60 minutes remind to calm down, breathe, and focus on myself; its not just a physical workout for me, but it helps me mentally as well.

As far as the studio itself and the staff are concerned, I don't know if I just have been really lucky in finding an amazing studio or if the entire Barre3 organization is like this, but I cannot say enough positive things about them. From day one they made me feel right at home. In the beginning of every single class the instructor goes around and introduces themselves to each person in the class and asks if anyone has any injuries so they can take that into account. The entire 60 minute workout the instructors are talking/walking you through each and every one of the poses. The try to push you to your edge, but also remind you to listen and respect your body. For any one of the poses/movements they show, they also offer modifications, which is incredibly helpful, especially for someone trying to rehab and injury. Sometimes when you are working out in a group you don't want to take the modifications because you don't want to look 'weak' compared to everyone else, but they are so encouraging and supportive that you never feel this way; some of the instructors do the modifications themselves as well! I recently went back home for a visit. While I was there I stopped by my old kickboxing studio to say ""hello"" to everyone and take a quick class. Everyone was complimenting me how great I looked and asked what gym I had joined. They were shocked to learn the only thing I had done was join Barre3. I never imagined in a million years that I would fall in love with Barre3, but my experience here has been nothing short of wonderful.",2015-11-18,NEGATIVE,0.9931634664535522

F8yozE3NWnImNApHO347gQ,Marrakesh,Philadelphia,PA,5,"This place is such a gem. We originally made a Saturday night reservation for two but I felt sick pretty last minute and we had to cancel (which they were really nice about). I was feeling a lot better by Monday so I called them that morning to make a reservation. They don't open until 5pm, so I was pleasantly surprised when they picked up my 10:50am phone call! When we arrived for dinner that night at 6pm, we realized that there was no need to make a reservation as the place was completely empty. A couple showed up as we were finishing our dessert, and they were the only other diners we saw all night.

Like many Yelpers have said, dining at this place feels like you're eating in someone's home. You eat everything with pita bread, which the waiter just left on the table next to ours since there was nobody else around.

Course 1. Trio of salads (eggplant, cucumber and tomato, carrot) - SO GOOD. This could've been a meal by itself.
Course 2. B'Stella (a pie with chicken, eggs, cinnamon, topped with powdered sugar) - It sounds weird and it is weird. Some people love it, but it just wasn't my thing. 
Course 3. Chicken (mild or spicy) - We went with mild. So tender, perfectly spiced and yummy!
Course 4. Beef kebab or lamb - We couldn't decide so our waiter let us try both! While I did enjoy the taste of the beef, it was too tough and hard to chew. The lamb is cooked with honey and almonds so I didn't think I'd enjoy it that much (meat + sweet aren't my favorite combo) but I loved it! It didn't taste too gamey and the meat fell right off the bone...mm, perfection. 
Course 5. Couscous with vegetables, chickpeas and raisins - It was good but I was so deep in my food coma that I don't remember much about this dish. I didn't love the addition of raisins though.
Course 6. Bowl of assorted fruit - I love ending any meal with fresh fruit, but I wish they had been cut up. This was literally just a giant bowl of fruit, like apples, oranges, grapes and bananas. There was so much variety but at that point I had no desire to peel an orange or deal with a whole apple. Call me lazy but I would've much preferred to eat a smaller portion of a fruit salad or something.
Course 7. Baklava and mint tea - I don't really like baklava in general, but this was really good. And the mint tea was the best I've ever had. We had a few cups of that before we headed out!

Our waiter was really attentive but didn't hover around or rush us. Not sure if that's because we were the only people there, but hopefully it's like that when the place is more crowded! The food is flavorful, the service is warm and polite and the price ($25/per person + tip) is a great deal. All in all, a really unique experience.

The tour lasted about 40 minutes, starting with a ten minute video of the history of Yuengling and the rise to present day. Next, the guide takes you out to the brewery, and into the kettle room, around through the lab, the bottle line, and the holding tanks. The tour was informative and hands on. Our guide was informative and knew quite a lot about the history and brewing process. She did a great job!

Once done, you loop back into the lobby where the tasting room is and it's drinks galore. The BEST PART? FREE. Tips are encouraged! ;)
We tried the Premium Lager, Lager, and Black and Tan. Sadly they were out of the Lord Chesterfield this day and the Premium Light is not available here in FL.

Overall, a great tour and I will be revisitng with my parents when they are in town!",2012-05-28,NEGATIVE,0.9990750551223755
YSJZZ1_8uHIIV4w44RSllA,Flying Pie Pizzaria,Meridian,ID,5,"For those who have never been, allow me to clarify a few things as I wax poetic on the greatness of this pizza and the establishment itself:

1 . This is not a quick ""grab and go"" pizza. If all you want is a quick fix, either go to some crappy chain, or just call ahead to order and tell them what time you expect to be in. 

2. You seat yourself, and you go to the counter (or the bar) to order. Their staff are often doing multiple tasks at once, so be patient. That being said, these are also the most kind, hilarious, talented, and quirky people in the business. If you treat them politely, they'll take great care of you; if you act like a pushy jack***, you don't belong here anyway. 

3. Yes, it takes time to handcraft a pizza. Unlike the pizza warehouses that shall go unnamed, the Pie staff don't make your pizza until you order it. This means hand-spinning the dough, adding all the toppings (which are fresh and delicious, may I say), and baking it. 
Baking doesn't happen microwave-fast. Grab a salad (maybe a beer or glass of wine if you're so inclined), play some pinball, have an actual conversation over the free breadsticks which will be brought fresh from the oven, and live like you're actually enjoying the company around you instead of cramming food in your face in order to sustain life. 

4. Don't get too attached to a beer, they rotate fast! There's always the Coors/Bud Light (not my bag), and the Triple Pi (made by local masters of all things beer, Sockeye Brewing, and only available at Flying Pi), but the other taps rotate about every week or two. You can also request beers tone brought on, and they'll kindly call you when the keg is tapped. They also allow you to sample so you can find a new beer you're bound to love. 

All this taken into account, get yourself a Zerto Magnifico (add cream cheese, your life will be forever altered), come for habanero season in August, and take some time to just enjoy the simple pleasures of great pizza, great beer, and great company. Honk the horn on your way out!",2016-01-30,POSITIVE,0.8142838478088379

The eggs florentine looked good. The other order was just a straight-up eggs benedict. However, the hollandaise sauce was a litte thin. Runny yolk thin. Spinach was a bit salty for my taste.

The space is small and they do have dine in tables (but no liquor license if you're here for brunch...but they do have mixers I'm told if you bring your own).  The staff was courteous and prompt. 

But on to the important stuff. The $1 croissant bites are genius. They melt in your mouth with buttery deliciousness but still have a bit of a crunch on the edges. I hate a mushy croissant. I also tried the mixed berry and apple turnovers. They were perfectly sized and the mixed berry was clearly the winner being tart and not too sweet. The apple was good to but the berry was amazing.  As I'm not a coffee person I got a perfectly tasty iced tea and was out the door.

The one thing that is lacking is their signage. Maybe it's building rules or maybe they just haven't gotten there yet. But blink and you'l miss them. They are riverside on Magazine between General Pershing and Milan...so dangerously close to home.

qAsPmtzmj3EAUjPSu-dqug,The Depot,Tucson,AZ,2,"We came here last night for a few drinks and to check the place out.  My fiance has been trying to get me to go, and my New Years Resolution is to stop saying no to everything new.

We walked in, and weren't sure if you had to seat yourself or if there was a hostess, but nobody at the bar acknowledged us walking in, so we just sat ourselves.  We were very quickly approached by a guy who sat a huge white binder on our table and explained, to my horror, that it was karaoke night.  I have taken singing lessons, have had solos in choirs, and sing constantly at home, but there is something about karaoke that I just wont do.  We sat for a while before the waitress came up and apologized for the wait.

I ordered and Arizona Sunrise, and Richard got the Hurricane.  Before we got our drinks, Mr. Karaoke came up and asked us if we had picked a song.  Richard said he had, but was trying to get me to sing also.  Our drinks finally came out and we ordered the Depot Sampler.  The karaoke guy came up again.  Five minutes later, he came up again.

We tried to order different drinks, but when I flagged the waitress down and said I would like another drink, she took that to mean I wanted the same one and didn't even ask Richard if he wanted another one.  When she got back, he said he would like another Hurricane and two Jaeger bombs.  The Jaeger bombs were warm, even the energy drinks were room temperature.  (during which time, the karaoke guy came up AGAIN, and asked if I needed more ""liquid courage"")

Our appetizers came out after a while, and it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing.  Actually, the mozzarella sticks, which I don't really like, were really tasty.  The breading on them was very flavourful.  Karaoke guy came up while we were eating.

Our waitress never came back after that.  I had been harassed enough by Richard(reminding me of my resolution) and the karaoke guy to sing Paradise By The Dashboard Light with Richard.  It was horrifying.  Nothing to do with the bar, or it's rating, but I did not want to do it, and it was just as humiliating as I had thought it would be.

We flagged down our waitress, who, when she was actually at our table, very pleasant and after another 10 minutes we got our check and left.  I think it was pretty expensive, after by myself having two Arizona Sunrises, two Jeager Bombs and a Blue Moon Beer to not feel any kind of buzz.  It doesn't take me a whole lot to get a little tipsy, and I sure didn't leave with that feeling.

First, I didn't receive my soda, and had to go get my waiter and ask him for it again. Not too big a deal, but then my daughter's chicken enchilada...had no chicken. We'd already begun eating, and our waiter hadn't come around to see if everything was OK. I asked her if she wanted to send it back but she said no, so, fine. The food itself was OK. We were hungry, we ate it. Her kid's meal was around $6.50, my crispy tacos $7.50, and my soda was $2. I noticed the prices on the menu, but wasn't adding up my bill ahead of time or anything because that's, you know, the restaurant's job. So I didn't blink when a check totaling $22.51 came, and I didn't pay any mind about tipping %20 (despite the faults, I've been a server before, so I can understand). In the end I paid $28. It was after we were long gone that I realized the total Should have been closer to $16, not $22.51. Did I get the wrong check and not notice? Did they add gratuity to a teeny little party of two without even telling me? Either way, that's a big no-no, right?  I wasn't being on my toes I guess, but I still feel a little ripped off.

cB_9eHHfo9me96cZup-lZQ,"The Saint Hotel, Autograph Collection",New Orleans,LA,2,"Summary: good service, lacking amenities, had a good time, one stay is enough.

First off, please don't see any of my complaints as reflecting poorly on the staff, all of which did a great job and deserve whatever employment they have. Most of the issues I had were beyond the staff's control and probably due to my own lack of research before I booked my room. That said...

There wasn't any bathtub, pool, sauna, spa etc, I realize this place is less expensive than the Ritz or other nearby hotels and I didn't realize until midway through the stay how much this would affect my stay. Room service closes at 10 or 11pm, which was a disappointment, and a small room service menu. Considering the prices for breakfast items, it wasn't very impressive and nothing seemed made to order. WiFi is very unreliable, I had a corner room and never had a consistent connection for more than a few minutes at a time. The guest computers in the lobby didn't have any kind of ""user profile"" system so be aware and erase temporary internet files if you use them - when I got on the computer the previous guest's Gmail info was all right there for me to get into if I wanted. 

The decor looks flashy but once you poke around you realize it's all pretty cheap stuff, the dresser drawers in my room didn't close all the way, towels were scratchy and thin, carpet was old and funky etc. Also the valet charges in the neighborhood of $35 for parking, there is a 24hr parking lot with tons of space literally 100 feet away that charges about $23. Breakfast buffet is around $20 for the same cheapo continental that you would get at say a Best Western. At one point the fire alarm went off because a drunk guest went out the fire door to throw up, everyone evacuating saw this happen as they went down the stairs, but we still had to leave even though it was confirmed there was no actual fire.

I would rather spend more money next time and stay somewhere with better amenities. If you want to stay somewhere cheap, stay somewhere that's actually cheap - this place was around $135 a night even with the Friends and Family discount. There are places for $70 per night that offer similar amenities.",2016-06-22,NEGATIVE,0.9995173215866089

The decor is a tad nicer than your average sports bar, but the layout is fractured into several small compartments and they have flat screen TVs galore, but they are not positioned in a way that most of the seated folks can comfortably watch the game. 

The menu consists of standard pizza, salad, sandwiches and pasta fare.  My lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it. I ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed. It was slopped in the bowl, drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites. The clam flavor was strong and overpowered the remainder of ingredients. My salad was soggy and too sweet. I know that local Italian salads have a tendency to be sweet, but this one was seriously over the top. Prices were a little high for the quality of food. 

Overall, my experience was just OK. I will go back if others invite me, but I won't go out of my way to eat here. 

BTW, I'm getting bored with the argument about provel cheese. It is a local favorite. Every area around the country has a ""cheese"" that's typically used, and here it is provel. Giving a restaurant 1-star because they serve a local favorite is ridiculous. Also, just because you've ""been around"" doesn't mean you are a cheese expert.

JUlsvVAvZvGHWFfkKm0nlg,El Camino Real,Philadelphia,PA,4,"N and I went for dinner with a couple who are from Texas, and they grudgingly admitted that the BBQ was pretty authentic. This pleased me, as it was also tasty. 

Between the four of us we sampled the short rib, the sausage, the brisket, and the enchiladas. Our house vegetarian was thrilled with the cheese enchiladas, and we carnivores enjoyed all the meats, although the short rib was definitely best. Sandwiches were under $10 and came with a side of fries. Good fries, but not outstanding. In Philly your fries have to be something special to stand out.

The night's big winner was the endless chips and salsa. I don't know for sure, but I suspect they make their own chips. In any case, the chips were fried crisp and dusted with cayenne. The green tomatillo salsa was good and the red chipotle salsa was fantastic; both were pleasantly spicy, but not mouth burningly so. As advertised, every time a bowl was empty the waitress offered to refill it. The Texans were miffed that there was a charge for chips and sals at all, but even they had to admit that the $2,50 was well spent.

Affordable doesn't mean cheap and dirty with Castillo Inn. Our room was clean and decorated nicely. The beds were comfortable and our room even had two tv's. The only thing that bothered me a little was that the cleaning staff did not re-stock toilet paper and towels, which meant we had to re-use towels and at one point had to use tissue paper since we ran out of TP. We tried calling the front desk but it was late at night so there was no answer. Check out was the following day so we just let things be.They should have been more on top of things than this. Other than that, everything else was fine. 

Our room was on the 2nd floor. The booking, checking in, checking out process was easy. The location is perfect. 1/2 a block from the ocean and within walking distance to their trolley stop and the marina. You can take the water taxi from the marina to take you to the pier for restaurants, ocean, beaches, pier, night life, shopping, landmarks, etc etc. The trolleys are inexpensive and great way to get around.

My wife daughter and I attended the final performance of ""Disney's Beauty and the Beast ""  on Sunday 8/6/2017 @ 2:00 p.m. Just a bit about the theatre. It is an historical landmark and harkens back to Trenton theatres like the Olden and Greenwood where many a baby boomer cut their teeth on movies with double feature .25 cent Saturday matinees. Not a bad seat in the house, although a nice upgrade would be replacing the seats during the off season. A nice supply of treats, candy and drinks at fair affordable prices are available. All staff members were friendly, warm, and willing to assist you to your seats, and answer any questions you may have had. Parking is iffy but we were lucky enough to find a spot on the street right across  from the theatre. ( FREE !!!! ).

All I can say about the performance was.....AMAZING!!!!!!. As limited as they are for space they pulled off the magic usually reserved for Broadway productions. Scenery, ensembles special effects and the leads in the show were nothing short of NYC productions, and all three tickets cost a grand total of $96,00. Nowadays you cant see a B'way show at mid premium seating for less than $175.00 a ticket ! All of the cast were excellent with a special shout out to Jennifer Garcia who was a delight as Belle. She uncannily sounded exactly  like the actress who voiced Belle in the Academy Award nominated animated feature for Best picture before a separate category for full length animated feature was established. The score was ""canned,"" but I personally preferred this to a so-so 7 or 8 piece live orchestra I heartily recommend you give yourself a treat and check out the Ritz to form your own opinion, but I'm sure you will be very satisfied with the entire experience. This was the final show of the season but they have a great lineup for 2017-2018 season. Highly recommended from a former lead singer in an all purpose band ( Clubs, Weddings, etc. ) for over thirty years.

dSPA4yql9vUwnYRxHiVtHA,Makiman Sushi,Philadelphia,PA,2,"Ordered from here twice. Poor customer service and unimpressive fish. 

The sushi was very meh the first time, but my roommate and I decided to give them one more try based on reviews. I think a lot of people leaving the good reviews have never had good sushi because Makiman is definitely sub par. 

Anyway, the second time I ordered some kind of fancy/special shrimp tempura roll and a salmon avocado roll. I don't know how hot the tempura roll was when they packaged it, but it made the salmon roll really warm. Not the rice, but the whole thing. Warm raw fish is not good and it grossed me out to where I couldn't eat it. I could have let this slide, but they also gave me a regular shrimp tempura roll instead of the one I ordered and paid for that cost double. I gave them a call about the roll and mentioned the warm salmon. The guy was super rude and told me that he's ""been packaging sushi for 10 years and no one ever complained about this."" Ok, jerk. I've been eating sushi for 10 years and never complained about this because it's never happened. 

He told me he would credit the extra $7 for the shrimp tempura from my next order. Told him there would be no next order after the conversation we just had and he said OK and hung up.",2013-12-08,NEGATIVE,0.9988640546798706

It exceeded all my expectations, especially because we walked by and stopped in without knowing anything about it. We were strolling around this neighborhood called ""The Gulch"" and thought to check it out. The restaurants all around it were rowdy pickup joints with screaming twenty-somethings drinking margaritas and this was a welcome relief. The bar has a beautiful view and we took advantage of it. 

We sat at the bar and had the deep fried buttermilk quail app. It was so delicious I wanted another. We were not convinced we were going to stay for dinner until the last bite of the quail changed our minds.

We both had the prixe fixe menu with wine pairing and ordered one of each of the choices. The grits souffle was DECADENT!!!!! I cannot begun to describe the flavor! Our dinners were superior. The filet was cooked perfectly and the chicken was heavenly and moist. The gnocchi side dish was light, flavorful and amazing. Whoever cooked it should be teaching chefs across the country.  Desserts came next. The panna cotta was rather unremarkable but the rocky road terrine left us fighting for the last bite.

Food temperature is important to me and I was not disappointed. The moment the food came out it want directly in front of us. Our bartender Josh was great about letting us change up the wine pairings. In addition, he was friendly and attentive.

I got a bowl of the rare beef and meatball pho to go while my dad opted to try their asparagus and crab soup. Total for the two items, $16. Yikes! (A bowl of pho in Hanoi is about $1; a bowl of pho in D.C. is $6 - $8. They were charging $10 for theirs)

The broth was okay, a tad salty, but when I added bean sprouts to the broth, it evened out. The broth lacked the subtle aromatic flavor that I'm accustomed to in a bowl of pho. The noodles were a bit chewy, and the meat was a bit on the tough side.",2011-10-03,NEGATIVE,0.9492935538291931

The pepperoni is really good. It's sliced thick and has a nice spicy kick to it. I wish I'd taken a picture, because each little square slice of the pie had a single slice of pepperoni on it. I found it amusing. 
They have decent garlic bread too.

Bottom line: If you're looking for New York style pizza, look elsewhere.

On my visit the ""restaurant"" was not yet open.  A food truck happened to be serving the food that evening.  The food truck had no name, just 2 dudes making some wicked fare.  By the time I had made my way to the food truck they had 86'd almost their entire menu, except of a Sweet Potato Gnocchi dish that is by far the best pasta concoction I've had in my entire life.  3+ years later I can still recall exactly what I had; it's not very often that happens for me.

Wr2k0Vz8RbcumYulp-jIrA,Han Dynasty,Cherry Hill,NJ,5,"I have a serious Han addiction.

I don't know if it was years of greasy sub-par Chinese takeout, or I was abducted by aliens. Whatever the reason, I am a Han fan girl now.

For starters, the Cherry Hill location is BYO (awesome). I've never tried the Philly locations, but I know they have alcohol available to them. The waitstaff and management is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, it's clear they are held to a high standard. The decor is simple, but clean and modern. It doesn't scream ""CHINESE RESTAURANT"" like many do. 

But the star is, of course, the food.

It's a ""family style"" deal, but I find for two people one entree plus an appetizer or an order of their yummy noodles is MORE then enough food. They always suggest their Dan-Dan Noodles for starters, and I've gotta agree - although if you are not fond of spice I'd suggest you'd ask the waiter to tone it down (which they will gladly do with ANY of their menu items) The nutty, spicy noodles are a great starter. I also love their Spicy Pickled Cucumbers, so crisp, flavorful and again SPICY.

There is a selection of entrees with a wild variety of meats to choose from. Ranging from the more familiar Kung-Pao style to the not so familiar ""Dry Pot"" or ""Dry Pepper"" Style. I personally always go for the dry pot style, because I LOVE the combo of the meat with the bamboo shoots and the sliced of garlic and peppercorn. Their food isn't just HOT it's massively flavorful. Although if your a spice junky like me, this food rivals Thai in its painfully good spice level.

The portions were small for what we thought the prices were. The ginger drinks were good, but not as gingery as we like (i.e. we enjoy really strong ginger drinks with a good kick). 

The decor is fun and cheeky, very much a representation of what the Bywater offers. The location is small so not good for larger groups. It is accessible as the entire spot is on one floor. We didn't use the restrooms so not sure if those are accessible.",2014-04-03,NEGATIVE,0.8565360903739929

The bad came when the hostess dual hatted as the bartender and we had to wait ten minutes staring at open tables before getting sat. We were offered free drinks as consolation which was nice but the waiting didn't end there. The waitress took forever taking our order and the food took about 30 minutes to arrive after ordering. Food finally came and there was nothing exciting about it. Blonde Benedict: eggs were so undercooked they were clear and fruit was underripe at best. Sunshine unlimited: it's an egg sandwich and a pretty crappy one at that. It was bland, needed salt (none on the table), and overall underwhelming. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",2013-10-27,NEGATIVE,0.9988518953323364

My favorite lunch has always been the curried chicken salad sandwich because it is always good. The combo of soup and sandwich was a perfect size and I got a cookie for dessert.

RuEIK45gBF5iDbYoSa9tOA,The Underground Tap & Grill,Edmonton,AB,3,"We went to the Underground Tap & Grill for the first time on a Saturday evening. We were expecting the place to be packed (Oilers game) but when we got there around 7pm, it wasn't!  Place is nicer than I expected with a very cozy, chilled out bar vibe. I really liked the music - good song selection and best part is that they don't blast it. You can actually have a decent conversation without having to scream and yell. A nice change of pace from the rest of the bars in town.

Anyways, beer wise, they have a great selection. You can pick from their regular menu (100-400 level which is categorized based on intensity/level of flavour). Then they have their rotational menu with quite a selection to choose from. A buddy and I got there early so we had a few beers and drinks before the rest of our friends came to join us. So I'm just writing about what we had:

- Guldenberg ($8) - 12oz beer from their rotational menu. It is 8.5% and from Belgium. I'm no beer expert but it was a blond ale and was well balanced.
- Wee Angry Scotch Ale (300 level) - dark ale that my buddy ordered. 
- Lowrider Double Rye Ale (rotational menu) - I believe this was the other beer he ordered. I can't remember the name for sure but it was a 12oz and it almost had a bit of a wine aroma to it.
 
- Green onion cake sandwich ($13) - a friend that had gone before told me that this was pretty decent. Comes with pulled pork, suey choy, tomatoes and green onions with a green onion cake as the sandwich. They claim it is homemade but I wasn't too impressed with it. I've had better green onion cakes at Asian restaurants. And for the price, definitely would not order it again. For my side, I had the garden salad with lemon honey dressing. Nothing special again.
- BBQ burger ($15) - 8oz beef infused with bbq sauce, cheddar and bacon. My buddy liked it but said he has had much better burgers. He upgraded to get the sweet potato fries.

Basically, good if you want to try beers. Mediocre for food (as you would expect for bar food in Edmonton). Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. Just go for a few beers.",2013-12-09,POSITIVE,0.9993256330490112

I have them leave off the tomatoes because it makes it too watery.   The indulgent every so often choice is the Pimento Cheese pizza.  This is greasy, so blot the pie with a few napkins and double up on the Lipotor and enjoy.

M0c99tzIJPIbrY_RAO7KSQ,Hyatt Regency St. Louis at the Arch,Saint Louis,MO,4,"We had a good stay overall despite small problems through out the stay and I would return. We stayed here for two nights, our first night we arrived early morning, we decided to park in the Mansion house. First of all the garage is a bit confusing if you've never been and hard to find an exit to walk out of ( we learned to park near the entrance if possible so we could walk out through there than go through the side stairs that smelled of urine or ""pissy stairs"" as we called them)but alas you get what you pay for so I didnt' expect much more than to save $. When we got checked in the lady checking me in wasn't very personable but wasnt rude or anything, maybe it was due to us being there at 5 am, not many people are awake at that time. As we got in the elevator to go upstairs the power went out and of course I wanted to get out since the elevators doors had closed and I thought we were stuck, but all I did was push the help button and the elevator doors opened and I was extremely relieved. Of course once the elevators were back up I was a little scared to ride it up to our floor but I did fine. The common areas of the hotel were nicely done, very classy and the room was nicely decorated, up to date, and we had a partial arch view. Same day but much later.....our room wasn't cleaned when we arrived after being out the whole day  so we were a little disappointed in that but all it needed was to have the beds made so it wasnt a big deal. Our second night I will have to say I saw an influx of people, seemed like a lot of college or baseball fans, one or the other. That night we were woken up by someone pounding on a door and shouting to be let in, I thought someone was surely trying to break in. It was our lovely neighbors who were having some kind of lovers quarrel, three guys trying to get back in their hotel room and a mad girlfriend not letting them in or something along those lines. My bf went out and set them straight and they left. Well I finally dozed off and again we hear this damn pounding loud enough to wake us up, I guess guy is finally allowed in but I still call front desk. Third time woken up is when security knocks on their door and they come out and speak so freaking loud I wake up again. Fourth time I hear a large group of girls and guys shouting. laughing, and interacting with the idiot next door. If it wouldnt have lasted less then a couple minutes security would have been called again. The rest of the night was fine but dealing with this definately put a damper on my night. The next day when we checked out we explained the situation and security had the info to back it all up. We were given a credit to one of their restaurants so I appreciated their effort since they didnt have any control over their rowdy guests.  Overall the hotel was in a nice location, great rooms, not such great neighbors if you get the college crowd, but overall since I got a deal on priceline I'd say it was a good place to stay and would return.",2012-09-10,NEGATIVE,0.9806884527206421

Do not be mislead by the internet claim that they accept credit cards- I figured they had a Square to swipe or something, but apparently you need to pay by card in advance (which I might have known had I gotten a confirmation email), so I needed to make an ATM run to get cash to pay when they were finished.",2014-06-30,NEGATIVE,0.9904749989509583

We walk it and its buzzing, I start feeling happy and giddy ready to have some fun with my gals. We go to check in and the gentleman there was awesome! I cant remember his name but he was employee of the year for 2012 and I can see why! So after checking in, we wander around for awhile then got to our room. Totally awesome. Great room we had a view of the pool and since it was a smoking room the windows opened! So that was the one benefit of the smoking room. Now here is where it all goes down hill. The service staff here is the worst. Except for the server at the 24 hour restaurant and our server at the steak house (i think his name was Franz). Other then that they all were horrible. Getting drinks at the bar, you would think i asked them to make 30 long islands not 2 grey hounds. And I have bar tended, so don't look at me crazy when you don't get tipped, because at this point I gave up on giving tips for shitty service. The pool service was a joke and every single staff member was completely rude. I get it you are in the heat and have to deal with people but its called fake it.

We went back to our hotel room and decided to play a game and guess what they never gave me the game. I called they didn't have and said to keep calling and they may find it. So i just chalked it up to the game gods and said wtf. Game was never found. As we went to our dinner the men who are at the bouncers at the club asked for our Id's (very rudely) and I asked all this for dinner (thinking maybe its a dinner club and they have a age appropriate  show) and he tells me nothing as we walk to the hostess the bouncer yells you guys aren't going to the club and at this point I'm so annoyed I yell back something like ""its 7:30 i don't know who goes to a club this early but its not us."" Dinner was wonderful and the food was good in the 24 hour place as well. But that's about it. I did have fun but only because I was with my friends. I can sadly say I was not impressed with the staff (even the bell hop was standoffish when he came to get our bags) and that made a huge impact. I was glad I had got a packet that had this room deal because had i paid full price I would have been livid. And one last thing. I tried to book another room visit prior to this visit because it expires in September and was told that they had no more rooms for this package. So i am now out 50.00 bucks for something that I can not use. Pretty shitty deal if I say so myself. (and i tried booking it in May)",2013-08-16,POSITIVE,0.999543309211731
1P_mGUY1PyPq7_ZabrzpBw,Carmine's Steakhouse,Saint Louis,MO,2,"Carmine's Steakhouse provides a reasonable Steak along with a admissible ambiance in DTSTL.

 After the raucous afternoon at the Rams game I decided that an agreeable meal was in order. Eschewing the Ruth Chris chain experience, I figured that Carmine's Steakhouse would offer a more uniquely ""Saint Louis"" feel. To be forthcoming it really feels like a Hotel Restaurant (as it is) which in and of itself is not a particularly bad thing, it is just the service was a bit stiff and forced for my liking. Also, the interior is quite dated.

The menu is about as stereotypical as Steak House dining gets and all of the usual suspects in Midwestern dining are well represented. The local favorite ""Toasted Ravioli"" was my first order in and is came to the table at breakneck speed. Basically it is the same as any Ravioli, just twice the size and Breaded and deep fried. Considering the great hype surround the dish i was honestly underwhelmed. It basically tasted like an amalgamation of Ground Beef, grease and Marinara with a bit of crunchy mouth feel mixed in. Ho hum at best but I came for steak, so it was not a deal killer at that point. 

As for the Steak, Carmine's does put out a very solid 21 day aged Bone-In Ribeye when they get the temperature right. On the kitchen's first attempt my Steak came to the table still eating the salad. After returning it to the kitchen (I loathe doing this), a perfectly marbled 20 ounce piece of charred delight came to my table seared to order (medium rare) along with Steak Butter on their second try. Returning meat to a kitchen in a Steakhouse always irks me, but at least they erred to the side of caution.  

As I side I ordered the Twice Baked Potato which was rather uninspired and boring thanks too being under-seasoned. 

In closing, Carmine's Steakhouse is probably a pass for future visits if and when I get back to Saint Louis as there are several other Chop Houses in the area that deserve a fair shake before a return trip. 2 stars and moving on.",2014-10-29,NEGATIVE,0.9892644286155701

Z5po0aTuzKKblek5y6Sp8Q,500 Degrees,Philadelphia,PA,5,"Checked out this place after seeing a post on uwishunu.com

Went with the 500 burger (lettuce, tomato, cheddar, bacon & special house sauce), truffle fries and a vanilla milkshake. I was starving by the time I'd gotten out of that line, almost a hour wait due to promos they were running with it being grand opening day and all, so I tasted a few of the fries as I walked back to the office, soooooo good! Wish I knew what the plain tasted like to compare not sure if I'm just in love with the truffle oil or if the fries as a whole are just that good either way the prices remain the same rather plain spicy or truffle. 

Then get back to my office and took a bite of the 500, it has bacon, real bacon on it!! Crispy salty in the right places chewy in the right places bacon. I don't know why but I have a hard time buying a good burger sandwich etc that has bacon on it and actually liking it so I was pleased. My burger was well done, and well seasoned, all around good burger. They did give me the wrong cheese however that may have been due to some order confusion so I let that slide and was still good. 

Lastly and my only real complaint is the milkshake. Very Very good no complaints there, the girl who made it however only filled my cup halfway and when I showed it to her, asking why it wasn't filled up she said because they don't have their correct cups yet so that is the actual serving. It looked like a serving for a kids meal so didn't sit right with me. Wasn't satisfied with that but walked away because I was hungry and needed to eat my food but saw that the guy in front of me was eating in and also ordered a milkshake so I asked to see his and there was a very small bit of space left at the very top, went back to let milkshake girl know this and asked the young lady next to me, also with a milkshake to be my witness LOL. She took my cup and put more in and don't think she was too happy about it but I got my reasonably portioned milkshake and it was goooood. And trust me I'm not that knit picky but  for money at that portion wasn't flying with me. Oh also with the milkshake it was more soupy than thick. I didn't mind that about it those that like shakes you need a spoon to actually eat not drink may not feel the same. 

They still get 5 stars from me for now because in the hustle of taking care of so many people, she may not have gotten a good look at my portion and she made up for it. AND they've filled a major burger void I'd been having so they're my new best friends right about now.",2010-03-23,NEGATIVE,0.9891467094421387

Share a couch or sit at the bar and enjoy all that Tippling has to offer. 

Overall, I like and enjoy this place, like the decor, like the drinks and like the bartenders. However, the cocktail list can get a bit pricey.  Two drinks for $34.00? What did we order? The menu is quite fancy and there are a lot of offerings.  I only threw back one egg white whiskey sour (which was delightful) so I need to be sure to come back to check out the rest of the spirits. 

Service took a bit of time, which was odd, since when I was here it wasn't crowded. 

The speakeasy feel is a bit overthrown by the open windows, well lit space and open floor plan but this isn't the 1920's/1930's- prohibition era has ended at last!  Comfortable and perfect for a smaller group.

We regret going there and I wish we would've taken them to a different restaurant. I made a reservation 4 days in advance and when we showed up they said they didn't see the reservation. We still got a table but it was right up front near the door and it was very uncomfortable. We had trouble getting situated at our high table and his grandparents had an ever harder time. We ordered oysters and none of them were cut properly so we had to scrape them out with our forks before we could eat them. After our appetizers came my boyfriends grandfather had to use the restroom and when we came back he told us there wasn't any soap so he told one of the employees. He intended to go wash his hands when our meals came out so that they would have plenty of time to refill the soap. Our meals came and he went back in the bathroom and the soap still wasn't refilled. Luckily, we had our own bottle of hand sanitizer with us so he had to resort to using hand sanitizer before eating his meal. The worst part is that he ordered a lobster roll. So it wasn't like he was eating with silverware. He had to eat his birthday meal with his hands that he couldn't even get soap to wash. Our total bill was around $160 and I really do not think we should've had to pay $160 for a meal that we couldn't even wash our hands before we ate it. We will never go back to Docs.

The staff members are pretty friendly and are always making sure our trash is taken away often along with getting our refills. Even with it being so busy, they still managed to keep up. 

I ordered a pitcher of blue moon and 2 different flavors of wings. One being Garlic Parmesan and the other being Lemon Pepper. To begin with they were pretty decent size wings. Not too small and puny like an anorexic chicken. The flavor was also delicious! I'd have to say it's one of the top wings here in town. I got my chicken wings naked with the sauce on the side to fully experience each sauce separately. With the right mixture of spice, garlic, pepper and lemon. OMGosh I was in heaven!

Then comes the hot sandwiches/soup station (and finally you order any other food items (like the chicken salade croissant at the register). You pay for your meal and they give you a number to have your food delivered to your table (drinks are not delivered you get your own fountain drink if you choose to pay for a drink). To the side of the fountain drinks there is a complimentary bread station with butter and jelly as well.

I decided to order the infamous the Chicken salade croissant (delicious) w/ a side of tomato basil soup and caesar salad, my wife had the Turkey & Brie sandwich with a side caesar salad...

I agree with Patty S.. It does remind you of a Miami style hotel. The decor is funky, unique and great for photo ops. The rooms are decent enough.
Most have little sunlight or views. A few offer city or Canal Street views. 

It is located next door to The Ritz Carlton and in front of the Courtyard Iberville. Same building but it has separate entrances.  All three are Marriott affiliated. It is located on the corner of Burgundy and Canal. 2 blocks from Bourbon and a block from Rampart. 

Generally speaking, it is the quieter end of downtown/Canal street hotels but during peak season or during large area events, you will be unable to escape the hustle and bustle. 

There is a pool table, bar and restaurant on the first floor. Breakfast is free for Gold and Platinum members. Wifi is also free for Gold and Platinum members. 

The suites are all located on the second floor and no two suites are alike. The presidential suite is named Lucifer and has views of Canal Street, a pole, strobe light and three flat screen tvs and lots of dark colors throughout. The Raphael suite has a separate tub and shower, large light colored sectional sofa and two tvs, one of which pops up from of a piece of furniture. 

The turn down chocolates are from Sucre' and there are always at least two or three staff members greeting you in the lobby. Voss Sparking water is also given daily.

DSbP-Z-khGxHnhu_0FqacQ,Complete Fitness Results,Brentwood,MO,5,"I LOVE CFR!

After extensive online research, I was impressed by the number of reviews consistently highlighting the personalized, structured attention to each client and CFR's individualized approach to all levels of expertise and physical status - especially focusing on each person's specific needs while creating a streamlined workout that while a challenge (and worthy reward) to maintain and grow within, IS attainable by those with the drive to follow through and invest appropriate effort. Having experienced the failure of several mainstream workout options, including: CrossFit, ""sheeple"" gyms who thrive off of intimidation style motivation, plus a surplus of environments that failed to provide instruction that gave me a sense of ability to accomplish a goal, these were incredibly appealing attributes for a potential investment of both time and money. After an initial call regarding package and pricing structure, where I received  viable information with a welcoming vibe, and a personalized consultation where my goals were addressed, I was confident in furthering my relationship with a company who saw me not as another dollar sign (but as a long term client) who would take satisfaction not only out of my credit card, but out of pride in helping someone achieve their goals, due to their passion for helping people in a specific skill field.

I have been MORE than happy to continue investing my time here almost solely based on the fruition of the above reasons for joining in the first place. Having had such high expectations, I could have easily been let down once I had paid my fees and started my membership. Exactly the opposite has occurred. I am continually challenged in a way that both exceeds and respects my comfort levels and boundaries. My trainer has adjusted and acted in accordance to the challenges I experience physically and mentally. I have never felt pressured to exert more skill or power than I have available, while being healthily pushed to limits I did not know I possessed. This has resulted in workouts that prove satisfying and intimidating; yet challenging while channeling an inner energy to try harder. The flexibility and attentiveness of all staff members, especially the person focused on my success has strengthened and encouraged me to lengthen my journey and efforts to reach my goals. My relatives and loved ones can attest to my improved outlook and attitude about my physical appearance and abilities - as well as a more positive, relaxed approach and outlook to daily challenges. I can 100% contribute to my current feeling of success and drive to my trainer Mike, the staff, the gym atmosphere and the obvious effort placed in long-term success as opposed to short-term exhaustion and burnt out results.

This is not a ""gym"". The emphasis on safe, proper form for all exercises is something that has proved unique and appealing in an industry that generally promotes overnight, impossible results (even though my coordination continually embarrasses me!). They may not aim towards leaving you incapable of movement within three sessions, but they certainly instill a value of ""quality over quantity"" wins the race. Seeing myself and the fellow clientele continue to come back and without fail, further their success level is testimony to the structure and strategy of CFR. I am thankful to finally be achieving goals previously thought unattainable - especially now, newly engaged, I am even more thrilled with my decision to sign-on for additional sessions... going to have to rock that wedding dress somehow - and I know they'll help me get there!",2014-04-23,POSITIVE,0.999795138835907

Parking was a bit tricky, we ended parking about 3-4 blocks away as the garage near the theatre was closed the night we came. Had fun though! Would recommend checking it out.

rViAhfKLKmwbhTKROM9m0w,Casino Del Sol,Tucson,AZ,4,"I am reviewing the hotel and the conference/meeting rooms.

First, the staff everywhere throughout this whole building is NICE NICE NICE. Everyone was beyond gracious and accommodating. I have zero complaints about the staff. They would obviously go out of their way to help anyone. Every bartender, every catering staffer, every hotel desk person, all of them, were SO customer-service oriented. Excellent all around in this area.

The hotel rooms (standard room, paid $99 a night for a Fri. and Sat. in early August) look nice now because they are relatively new but I am not sure they will hold up over time. Very spacious for such a low price and the views are great. 

However, the room walls are paper-thin. I mean PAPER!! I heard everything (even the normal volume conversations -- in detail--- happening in the room next door). My neighbors also had a baby that cried for over 3 hours one day which made napping impossible. I have never heard so much through a hotel room wall before. This is a definite problem and I suspect they hear a lot about it from patrons.

Another review mentioned that the room lighting is bad. This is true. It was nearly impossible to put on makeup even though they had a nice magnification mirror in the bathroom. I tried every spot and couldnt find a place with lighting. I ended up sitting by the window because it was still daylight and holding up my tiny compact on the couch. This is a small but highly frustrating thing for a woman. 

The shower and bathrooms are very nice in the rooms. High quality and the water was warm. I really liked the bathroom. So clean, too!

The TVs are pretty neat because you can check-out on them. 
The free wi-fi was spotty and made me login again on their page over and over. 

The AV in the meeting rooms was cruddy. The mics went in and out and had a lot of interference. However the system is built-in rather than set up like most AV places, so I guess you get what you pay for.

The art in all the conference rooms was gorgeous but it was so cold in all of them that I left my meeting to go defrost. I am not an ""always cold"" person -- lots of other people were frosty too.

Conference room catering was good for the most part. Some things were high quality and delicious, others felt and tasted very mediocre chain-like. Hit and miss.

The pool was always crowded with families. Not a relaxing environment at all. 

Spa service menu was very reasonably priced but not a lot of options. No deep tissue massage?!

I would go back. I want to try the steakhouse.",2014-08-11,POSITIVE,0.998371422290802

I am undocumented, which explains my unstamped passport, but my passport is a legitimate form of identification, government issued. The hipster bouncer (I wish I had his name) white, pale and an ego full of unfounded power told me that because I was undocumented, I needed to leave because he wouldn't take my passport. I just want to say that it's illegal to a) go through a passport as if you were homeland security, not even TSA can do that and b) he targeted me for identification, my white friend was told he didn't need to provide ID.

For my entree, I got their sampler plate which came with the chicken curry, which was out of this world tender and very tasty, the jerk chicken, which was way to spicy for my liking, and the brown stew which was also very good.

FYw5uf26ry8-MuPKD10z0Q,Josef's Vienna Bakery & Cafe,Reno,NV,1,"This is the second time my husband and I have come to Josef's - expressly to get an assortment of cookies - so I can't speak on behalf of the meals they serve.

Just before the holidays, we came in to get a dozen cookies. Since they were just for my husband and I, I thought even 12 cookies was extravagant. There was only one gal behind the cash register helping a short line of customers. The service was VERY slow. When our turn came, I mentioned that I wanted just an assortment of cookies. Immediately, the gal tried to HARD SELL me on the pre-made-up platters of cookies that were heaped on a large table in the entrance area. I kept saying ""NO, that's too many!"" But she just wouldn't listen, and kept telling me that this assortment was ready to go. 

When I *finally* got her to listen to me - the customer - I told her I wanted just one cookie from each line in the top two shelves of the display cabinet. Over and over and over and over I had to repeat this ridiculously simply request. Even my hubs was wondering if the gal understood English? She kept asking what we wanted, and then 15 min into putting some of the cookies into a box, I said, ""So what have we got here?"" And she said, I've got 5 cookies - what else did you want? Seriously, it was like some kind of skit on SNL. How difficult is it to grab ONE each of SIX different cookies on TWO shelves? We got the cookies and I have to admit: they were DELICIOUS! I think cookies (and probably cakes & pastries) baked at the holidays are bound to be good and fresh because of the turnover.

Flash forward to yesterday. We returned with a sweet tooth to get just six cookies for us. One gal behind the counter was on the phone as we approached the cash register. She remained on the phone a couple of minutes (with no greeting whatsoever), then hung up and disappeared in back. Um. OK. Anyone HOME? After waiting 5 minutes, a different gal came out to take our order. This time, we got the cookies we asked for and went home to try them. HORRIBLE! 

We took a bite from 4 of our 6 cookies purchased, and found they tasted like rock hard sawdust. I am not kidding. I bake cookies myself, and I know that when you bake them fresh - DAILY - they should be moist and tender. Yes, they look pretty all dolled up in frosting and daubs of jam, but the flavor is absolutely flat - not a hint of butter or sugar in them. I guess they use lard? I also suspect that the cookies stored under the hot lights of the display case are not only dried out beyond repair, but were probably baked a good week ago. I broke a Cary cookie in half and it just shattered like glass! The cookie was dry as a biscotti, and tasted like some kind of stale dog biscuit. 

These cookies are an insult to Josef (if he is even alive and cares what is baked and sold in his store). We will not be returning to Josef's again for ANY dessert of any kind ever. I was so mad about these stale biscuit cookies I chucked them all in the garbage. Money down the drain. 

You may as well get a small cookie or two at Whole Foods, or even a small box of infinitely fresher cookies at Trader Joe's! Josef's so-called Vienna Bakery is a total Fakery.",2014-03-14,NEGATIVE,0.9994798302650452

rL68WmPRYvmSjRaQUoKwkQ,Social Gastropub,Edwardsville,IL,2,"Should be a 2.25 total rating. Here is The Good The Bad The Ugly and Low Down Foo

The Good- I am struggling to find something amazing about it. I wouldn't say good but just ok the Cuban and Mac and cheese (needs salt and pepper). Our waiter rocked though.

The Bad- not sure I would classify this as a gastro pub based off 3 factors: 

1. the ambiance it's more of a sports bar/ banquet with white linens, weird wall paper, big screen tvs playing sports and a big wide open space, a true gastro pub should have a cozy or rustic vibe that makes you want to relax and enjoy it. 

2. Should have extensive craft beer and cellar beer list... I believe  they had 20 beers most were domestic bud, bud light and the like. 

3. The food should be out of the box or fun plays on food. But it was just ok those Blue Chips where very bad though...Very bland blue sauce that seemed to be mixed with whole milk and was watery and tasteless. They could make it  amazing with chunks of blue, thicker sauce and something more to cut the salt on salt flavor.

The Ugly- craft beer 101 don't bring me a beer with a frosted mug it makes you seem like you don't know what your doing. You do not ever ever ever bring a beer in a frosted glass it waters the beer down. Also live band outside was way to loud.

The Low Down Foo- I think this place has an identity crisis... It's called a gastro pub but does have any of the features of one... But looks like a sport bar / private even space. 

I wish them the best but they just don't have any reason to get us back... Out of the 3 categories we rate gastro pubs this one failed all 3.",2015-06-21,POSITIVE,0.5672300457954407

I finally made it down to Kanella in the daytime; thought the cozy dimly lit taverna style restaurant, with albeit consistently mouthwateringly delicious food, would loose some of its flare in the AM, but oh how I was wrong. 

I admit, I was more than a little suprised when I read Esquire's choice of best breakfast (does Kanella even do breakfast?). But when I arrived at Kanella around noon, sunlight was streaming through the giant windows, highlighting the lovely bouquets of flowers and potted plants, and upon glancing over the breakfast/brunch/or lunch menu, I saw the same simple sophiscation, and understood why Kanella had got the vote.

My party of three ate family style, sharing the Kanella platter (fantastic, and I mean the BEST stuffed grape leaves I have ever tried; light and fluffy zuccini fritters; a nicely dressed salad; and more) accompanied by the Yemen Pastry (fried yes, but utterly light, crisp, and savoury) with spicy tomato salad, and last but not least the Cypriote Breakfast, complete with grilled haloumi, perfectly fried eggs and lounza, a salty ham...wow was it all soooo very good! 

To top it off I indulged in my second cup of the day, and was amazed to find a restaurant that offers a strong cup of coffee! 

Moreover I finally met the other owner, and chef's other half, his very lovely wife who helped serve us, and was just as welcoming and warm as her husband.

We collect our dog poop for a week and put it in a bucket until trash day, we also add a little dirt to the bucket to keep the smell down. We forgot to through it out before the tenting and left the full bucket in the yard.  
I called Jhonny's and asked for someone to come out and explain why they did this and clean it up.
Two days later someone came over to look at it. They didn't bother cleaning it up and they lied, saying they got dirt from the ground and not the bucket. I told Jhonny's employee it was to much of a coincidence that the bucket of poop was entirely empty and the area where they had to add dirt smelled of poop.

Well. 5 weeks ago my husband and I purchased our beloved Tzatziki Zeke, a 4 month old pineapple green cheek conure from this store. We were told that he came from a breeder here in town who hand raises them and that she is where they source all of their conures. I cannot speak highly enough about the dispositions of her birds! He had been in the store for just over a month and they admitted that he hadn't gotten much interaction due to the other larger birds in the store. We purchased him after going to see him 3 times over 4 days. The sun conure and parolettes of her's were also all really sweet! We were concerned it'd take a long time to earn Zeke's trust considering he had spent a quarter of his life in the petstore even if he was previously hand raised. From his first night home he has been an absolute dream. He has brought so much joy to our lives. We have even proclaimed him the best pet ever (just don't tell our cat and two dogs).  Honestly, you really don't know what you're missing out on until you've cuddled a bird! Anyhoo. Since acquiring our feathered friend we've spent a small fortune on various toys and other supplies and of all the places we've gone to look, we have found that when it comes to furnishing a birdie abode no other pet store offers more selection. I agree with the previous poster's comment regarding the cleanliness of the ferrets cage... I do see definite room for improvement there, but they are doing a lot of things right. If they focused on the animals enclosures a bit more and brought their pet presentation up to the level of their broad selection of well organized pet care products, I think they'd have the best pet store in town. We will definitely be back.",2015-03-05,NEGATIVE,0.9491066336631775
kjhIbW8NKRvXmLDwz7lzhw,Margaritaville - Nashville,Nashville,TN,3,"Three stars is pretty much on the money. I don't understand a Margaritaville in Nashville but I also am probably not the actual target demographic of these places...see: my dad who sometimes makes me think he can't find anything else on his XM radio other than Margaritaville. 

So we've of course been to the one in the Caymans and on Key West. Since clearly these are out of the way places, I didn't get in the way of my parents having their experience here. 

I was kind of hoping to avoid listening to music...or at least if I was going to have to listen to covers, NOT ""Call Me Maybe"" gone country. It's somewhat loud in here and I imagine as the night goes on it's louder. We were here prior to a hockey game but it was still pretty busy. 

Since I procured my family a free app coupon I decided I was worthy of the 5 o'clock somewhere which is a take on a Hurricane, which somehow in five years of legal drinking I have never had before. It wasn't bad. I imagine it's one of those things where you're like ""oh this barely tastes like alcohol, I'll have another"" and then suddenly you're hitting on someone you shouldn't be hitting on. Wait what.

For that free app, we had the spinach artichoke dip. It wasn't bad, I certainly wouldn't have let anyone pay full price for it though. 

I wasn't feeling like having a full on sandwich or anything but there aren't really any smaller sized options. I guess a cup of soup but I had had soup for lunch and it was like obscenely hot for December so that was out of the question. I decided to just get the chicken quesadilla app and if I didn't finish it then whatever. The rest of my family had burgers or a chicken sandwich. The burgers were liked all around, although my brother got the diablo one and complained that it wasn't spicy enough. But I don't think he understands that poblanos aren't that hot.

The quesadilla wasn't bad, there were some spots though where the chicken was a bit tough. Nothing you can't fix with a good bit of salsa though. 

Even though like I said it was pretty busy, we were there only about an hour. Service was great. Would I come back on my own? Probably not. In my case it's really one of those places where once is enough for the experience but if I were asked to come again, I wouldn't say no.",2013-12-29,NEGATIVE,0.9944714307785034

lsGZzXIJbjrWtcFGLAW5sw,AM@FM,Nashville,TN,5,"Okay, where do I begin?  So much L O V E for Arnold Myint and his amazingly random and wonderful restaurants.  This one is my favorite spots in Nashville so far for casual, no-pressure dining.  Here's my top 5 as to why:

1. I got half of a turkey sandwich, a side of sesame-chili eggplant salad, freshly homemade potato chips, mint lemonade, and a perfect slice of a Mexican chocolate-coconut brownie to round off this most refreshing meal for under $10 with tax and tip.

2. I love the farmer's market relaxing, open atmosphere, and I love even more that am@fm has a ""bar"" style seating available where the staff waits on you.  Such a cute, well-decorated nook!

3. The options that they offer may SEEM limited upon first glance, but if you read the descriptions of each sandwich and salad, you soon realize that your options are in fact limitless.  The little refrigerator you see before you boasts such a fantastic variety of styles and flavors and sings to anyone who walks their way.  Vegan?  No problem!

4. I hate going to restaurants where I immediately think: ""I could make this myself, only better.""  That thought never crossed my mind here!  They play on very simple food items (sandwiches, salads, chips, brownies), and just pump up the volume on them by adding great flavors through savory/sweet spices, and an interesting new play on added ingredients.

5.  As an added bonus, they have an AWESOME touch pad to pay for your food (if you pay by credit card).  They check all of the items you purchased, and hand it over to you to add tip and sign.  Then it e-mails you your receipt!  Love the environment-friendliness of it all!

Returned Monday to pick up the shoes - spent 10 mins waiting around while they randomly and idly perused the shop looking for my shoes. They had no idea where they were. Finally 10 mins later they found them, and they hadn't been touched. I took them back and walked out.

It's this seaweed mud mask cocoon wrapping heavenly facial/head massage deal.

Upon check-in, the gentleman at the office was very friendly and informational. He oriented us on great places to eat and what places we can go to that are nearby. No key cards, they use old school keys. Which I thought was pretty cool. 

Location is perfect! You can see the ocean from the Inn. The beach is literally just down the street. It's a mile away from State St. I was a little worried about what the rooms would look like judging from the outside of the Inn, but the room was simple and surprisingly very clean. Room comes with mini fridge, coffee maker (a little dirty), portable air-conditioner, cable with HBO, and wifi. Bathroom and shower were clean and came with mini shampoo and soap. Was not expecting cleaning service but it was a nice little surprise going back to the room with the bed made and fresh new towels. Pretty roomy for a queen sized bed room.

Next time I used them, they stored my clothes under the wrong name and number ( quite a hard thing to do since I had picking up clothes at the same time I dropped those off, and they already had my name up in their system). Tip: Never lose your green slip or you may never see your clothes again!!

When I got home,  I inspected my black and white formal dress. They ruined it. The white had grey stains all over it. When I brought it back to show them, the blamed it on ""dirt that got inside the lining of the dress"". Apparently, I rolled around in the dirt in my formal dress so much that it got trapped between layers of sewn together fabric. This ""dirt"" conveniently was invisible to the naked eye until it was dry-cleaned. 

When I asked to speak to the owner, they said to call ahead the next day to make sure he's in before I come. I told them that I would come at noon and to let the owner know that. The next day I call at 11:30 to remind them. They tell me that there's no need to talk to the owner. He confirmed that it was dirt inside the dress and has left. They can fix it but that it will be hard and expensive. How convenient. Ruin my dress and then up-charge me clean it again, all the whole complaining about how hard it will be to clean.

The aisles are pretty well organized, though the frozen food section is a bit lacking. I noticed some patrons also had difficulty navigating through the large amount of items. The store organizes based on ethnicity, but not in any particular alpha-numeric order. Of the many I saw, there were specific aisles for Chinese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese food. I was pretty impressed by their fresh produce section covering about a third of the store and the extensive live fish selection along the entire back of the restaurant.

We stepped in and they actually were able to seat us early (8pm instead of our 8:45 reservation). The service really is impeccable. I almost wish I got wine so we could experience the sommelier who seemed amazing.

We ordered a la carte because we are not yet filthy rich. For our antipasti, we got the TEMPURA SOFT SHELL CRAB which was ugh sooo goooood. Then our bread came, which was weird, and I thought the focaccia was to-die-for, the white tuscan not so much. For pastas we tried the SHRIMP & RICOTTA RAVIOLI, which just melted in your mouth but I think it reminded me too much of shrimp shu mai. We also had the DUNGENESS CRAB SPAGHETTI which was really disappointing - really salty, no crab to be seen, and the pasta was really hard and I know that's not what al dente is. Our secondi was the special, a SUCKLING PIG dish that was pretty much perfect, really decadent and crispy and salty and sweet.

So it was a mixed experience. I really expected better pasta (and bigger portions of it), but the antipasti and secondi were amazing.

I am not going overboard with the description. Just order the Poutine... it is mind-blowing.

The waiter recommended a wine. I can't remember, but it was delicious. Maynard's has a very good drink selection as far as cocktails and wine go. I ordered the pork shank.

My meal there was fantastic. For starters, the ambiance of the place is really nice. Cool lighting setup, cute little bar at the front of the restaurant, and a big balcony outside that overlooks the Schuylkill and will be great in the spring. 

The meal started with a complimentary dish of toasted (i think?) nuts that was really tasty and a welcome alternative to the usual basket of bread. We ordered the spicy mussels, which came with a nice, buttery, crusty bread for dipping in the sauce. The sauce, while really tasty, was not really spicy -- my only complaint. 

Our main dish was the cippollini pizza: pancetta, brussel sprouts, goat cheese. An absolutely delicious mix of sweet, salty, and spicy. I loved it. The pizza had a nice char from the wood-fired oven but the crust still remained chewy. 

I do think the restaurant is still figuring itself out a bit. We were sitting at a bar overlooking the kitchen, and our server openly admitted to having a rough time serving us in that area. Also, they serve the pizza on top of a big can of tomatoes, which looks cool, but when the guy brought our pizza he said ""watch out, the plate is really hot and unsteady."" Not really the best combo; they might want to rethink that.

The Spot is combined with Ha Long Bay. You can actually order Pho with your sushi burrito! Anyway, if you walk into ""The Spot"" side of the restaurant, you will see that you order your burrito like you would a certain fast food Mexican burrito.

First you pick burrito, bowl or salad. Then you pick your protein. You can pick two or three for a higher price. Then you pick sauce, veggies, and toppings. Then you watch your beauty be wrapped into a burrito. 

I ordered a burrito with salmon and tempura shrimp (I highly recommend both). I then asked about the sauce and was recommended the spicy sauce since I am a heat fiend. I added cucumber, carrots, and jalapenos. I then added sesame seeds and little crunch wontons for texture. 

Some of the things that you could also add that I remember were tuna, corn, cilantro, red onion, avocado (upcharge), asparagus (upcharge). There were a lot of other choices too, but that is what I can recall.  

I grabbed a drink, a container of soy and lots of napkins (note: grab extra! Burritos are a little messy if you are like me and dip in soy).

The first bite was magical. It was super fresh, delicious, salty and crunchy all at once. Each subsequent bite just reinforced my joy. I polished it off and left very happy. I will definitely return soon. It is a little pricey, but I think that it is worth it. You have to try a sushi burrito if you are a sushi fan. You will love it!",2018-01-13,POSITIVE,0.540142297744751

The greens are a little torn up i think that is because you see people miss treating the greens.

Like trying to whack a ball off the green with there wedge What the heck!!!

I never played the mini golf honestly the mini golf doesn't look very impressive though.

The driving range is fine.

I dont have the skill level to play a full game of golf yet and this place is good because the holes are only 60 yards so you only need two clubs a wedge and a putter perfect for the beginner.

They have lender clubs too if you dont have your own.

Im glad my friend took me up here.

Its a good leisure activity for poor people like me because it only costs 8-12 Bucks.

d91RHJeZE-I7TaeQdBp6MQ,Five Guys,Harahan,LA,3,"So it finally happened....after YEARS of people telling me that I ""NEED"" to try a Five Guys burger because it was the most amazing thing on this earth (according to rumor)....I did. It's absurd the amount of times I felt like I had somehow offended someone on some deep seeded personal level because I had not had a Five a Guys experience. I figured, ""Man, what a loyal fan base. They must know what they are doing."" I tried not to get my expectations up too high from all the hype, but it was hard not to expect some sort of spiritual and divine cheeseburger religious experience...

I got a cheeseburger, a regular Cajun fries, and a coke. And MAN I wish I split that order with someone! I didn't realize that a regular cheeseburger was a double patty! If I had known I probably would have ordered the ""little burger"" instead (which I assumed was a junior cheeseburger but come to find out it's actually a normal sized burger). Also, I love my burger fully dressed and at Five Guys, fully dressed comes with: mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, and grilled mushrooms. Plus there's more toppings available upon request. So between the toppings and the double patty it all certainly adds up to be a pretty hefty burger. 

The Cajun fries where GREAT but SUPER salty from the all the seasoning they put on them, so I probably drank enough coke to be MADE of coke by the time I left ( good thing there's free refills).

The free peanuts are a cool idea. Not like you have any time to eat them since the food comes out super FAST! There was tons of people there and huge line almost out the door when I showed up at peak lunch hour but they kept it moving quickly and I barely had time to fill my drink and pick a table before my order was up. 

This place is nothing if not PURE EFFICIENCY I'll say that much. They hustled so much behind the counter that I felt like I needed to swipe on an apron and help out myself! 

The staff was very friendly and the girl taking my order was great at explaining how everything worked. 

I know a big complaint at Five Guys is the cost. But for a double patty burger, giant fry portions and a drink I can't really complain at $11. Plus I probably won't ever order that much food in the future. Next time I'll probably get a small fries and a ""little cheeseburger"" instead of regular fries and a regular cheeseburger.

Pros: FAST and friendly service, big portions, fairly priced.

Cons: I found the patties to be a bit on the thin size but it certainly didn't disappoint.",2014-07-31,NEGATIVE,0.5856760144233704

My partner ordered a pizza by phone for pick-up. When we arrived to pick-up our pizza the staff was unenthused and less than stellar at giving good customer service. I went to the counter and the guy asked me what was my order, I said the name our pizza was under. Apparently, they don't use names on the order. (Remember my partner ordered so I didn't know they hadn't asked for one.) He asked what kind of pizza it was, and I told him I didn't know, that I was not the one who ordered it. He said ""How could you not know what kind of pizza you ordered?!"", with a condescending tone. I called my partner over and then at that time another man yelled from the kitchen was it a...? And he listed the ingredients on our pizza. My partner confirmed that it was and then we went to pay. They don't tell you over the phone that this is a cash only restaurant. So when I handed him my card he said, ""Can you read the sign, it's cash only! We have an ATM."" 

2014 and we don't accept credit cards? 

After getting our pizza we arrived back in the car and began to drive about a block when my partner, who was holing the box, began to feel his leg getting hot. The ""Over Saturated Pizza"" had so much sauce it was coming out of the box onto his lap and burning his skin! 

Once we cleaned the outside and inside of my car from pizza sauce pouring out of the corners of the pizza box, my partner changed his clothes from being covered in pizza sauce. We tried to sit down and enjoy it. However, the dough was just that...dough. There wasn't crust because it was that undercooked. The sauce was horrible and saturated the dough.

sGbjViru0iJfxH5cBpMeHQ,August Moon Chinese Restaurant,New Orleans,LA,4,"I don't eat a ton of Chinese takeout because I haunt various local Asian markets and buy and cook the stuff myself. But a small cooking accident and a burned hand lead me to order out at this South Chinese/Vietnamese place, and I was pretty satisfied with the result.

My order was hot and freshly ready in just under ten minutes; I barely had time to hit an ATM around the corner. It wasn't super cheap; I paid for two dishes what I would have paid for three at the cheapest of such places, but the portion sizes were such that I'll get 2.5-3 meals anyway, which is about right for the price. And it was respectable American Chinese cuisine, with my Kung Pao dish highlighted by a mix of vegetables and a decent amount of peanuts, and my lemongrass tofu having the option of noodles or rice with a little salad and separate sauce on the side. Nothing world-beating (and if I wanted to, I could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot), but I got a good meal.

For some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical Chinese food cartons, and I was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage; even being cautious, there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag. If they wanted five stars from me, they could do things like improve those containers or not sneak broccoli into dishes where it isn't listed or offer non-soy vegetarian dishes for variety, but their menu now isn't bad.

Their online menu proudly proclaims that the dishes in its vegetarian section are ""prepared with vegetarian ingredients"", which sounds redundant until you realize that Chinese places can and will sneak in something that isn't. So I appreciate that notification, and will most likely order something else from that menu the next time I decide I want Chinese takeout.",2018-05-29,POSITIVE,0.977929413318634

0qu0fNTOsSmuREYVIMPuIQ,Cold Spring Tavern,Santa Barbara,CA,4,"Little did I know there's an alternate route heading deeper into Santa Barbara County with the 154, and perhaps the one of the things that make the little detour worth the drive is making a stop into this quaint little spot. 

The tavern used to be an old stagecoach stop back in the days people used actual horsepower to power their transport, and the original structures seem to have been kept intact from those days. The clientele mostly consists of people who like to take their transport of choice and drive it around with people who have similar transports of choice as they (READ: bikers and people with cool, classic cars). The place itself is split into two structures: the tavern and the restaurant. 

We were there for lunch, so we got to sit in the room with the big window and HUGE fireplace. The menu is fairly small but offers a nice selection, and I went for their standard, famous chili (I dare not try their ""fancy"" chili with black beans and wild game including rabbit...I don't eat the bunnies :C ), and I decided to have it atop a plate of fries. Very very yummy. I had a lavender martini to go with it, which was made with  fresh lavender picked from the outside! That was okay. The winner, however, was The Smuggler, a spirited dessert coffee drink made with creme de menthe (or peppermint schnapps?). Now I'm a HUGE mint fiend, and I already expected it wouldn't be minty enough for me, but surprisingly perfectly minty! 

The prices of everything isn't a great deal, but it's still pretty fair.

I took a peek into the actual tavern, which was pretty cool looking. I'd gladly have a drink in there, or outside the place, as you can do and would want to do on a nice day as it was when I went, but by no means am I going to have a hankerin' to drive allll the way over there just to have a few cold ones. All the same, if ever I'm the area again, I wouldn't hesitate upon the suggestion to go here (READ: I'd more likely go here before I go to Pink's again).",2007-05-17,POSITIVE,0.986286461353302

Had the brussel sprout appetizer, yummy, lots of flavors and textures going on in there, good serving for 4, could probably order this as a meal to go for one

Ordered the shrimp en cocotte (shrimp and grits) asked for pouched eggs on top. Grits were jalapeño flavored but GOSH, they must have put a brick of jalapeño jack on there cuz that was all tasted! Shrimp was smaller than expected, gravy was good, not much grits under all that cheese, I had to pick all these cheese out cuz it just overpowered the whole dish (next time, ask them for less cheese or none cuz it didn't need it), best part was the 65 degree sous vide egg(I'd probably love the 75 degree egg more), it was just perfect!

Had the chocolate steamed something with salted caramel ice cream. It was ok. The salted caramel ice cream tastes like pure sugar  no depth and ridiculously sweet (bi-rite makes salted caramel way better). I had one bite and that was enough

My friends and I had come in during the last week of June for the first time since the move/owner change. There was quite a bit of America decoration, but it didn't really phase us, as it was entirely seasonally appropriate. However, we knew there was something a little creepy going on when we came back at Christmas and it was all still there. The whole place screams ""'MURRRICA!!!'"" a little too loudly. Plus, they pepper the waiting area with Christian paraphernalia. I love that we have a free country where you can garishly display your religious preferences however you like,  but at the end of the day it can turn people off. 

That aside, it was a little overpriced for what you get, which is basic-ass breakfast food. Besides the Patriotism being shoved down your throat with every bite, the restaurant is housed in an old dance studio, so the atmosphere is a little off. The service is slow and forgettable.

WbA5ud4InNWkizW7HE5kRQ,Penca,Tucson,AZ,1,"My wife and I have had some wonderful meals at Penca, but it's become so painfully inconsistent that I feel obligated to write this critical review.

Our waiter tonight was named Alex. He was inattentive and slow - it took 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive after ordering them (one of which contained a gnat), and this was on a quiet weekday night with only 3 or 4 other tables seated. He also did not put our appetizer order in, though it was ordered clearly and he seemed to acknowledge it. This was disappointing because the appetizer--the Queso Fundido, a hearty melted cheese and sausage dish--was one of our favorites!

The food we did receive was subpar compared to other visits. I ordered the Mole de Guajolote, described as ""braised turkey in mole poblano, pickled gray squash, rice, tortilla."" What I got was a bowl of rice topped with lightly-sauced shredded turkey and 3 tortillas on the side. This lacked any sort of wow factor, whether in flavor, ingredients, or presentation, and seemed completely overpriced at $21.

The ribs were tender but underseasoned, while the hominy, usually a stellar side at Penca, was undercooked and oversalted instead of the tender, creamy bites of heaven it can be.

This experience was not helped by the fact that the front door was broken, causing monsoon season winds to blow through the restaurant and scatter menus, while the leaky roof also dripped in several places. Sorry Penca, but we're just not into you any more.",2017-08-11,NEGATIVE,0.9987401366233826

4_W5pstoN1166TGjjPOrMg,Prohibition Taproom,Philadelphia,PA,5,"i live a block away from this place, yet took nearly a year to venture that long block to what may be my favorite bar in the city. 

the bar is pretty low key, rarely very full, and a decent place to bring friends or a date. the noise level is acceptable with a great jukebox and, in the few times i've been there, douchebros have been minimally invasive. there was one night that some guy was trying to read a book and some dudes were being total assholes right behind him. i mean, it is a bar, so i don't know why anyone would be trying to read there, but these guys were exceptionally annoying. that was an isolated incident, though.

now, i didn't drink beer regularly until a few months ago (i don't really like any of the shitty beers that typically populate college parties, so i'd usually just try and get drunk off of vodka or gin), so i don't know how qualified i am to judge the beer selection. from what i've seen at other bars, prohibition's beer list isn't super extensive, but there's a good variety of beers both on tap and in bottles. the bartenders are nice, attentive, cool folks who know what they're talking about way more than i do.

now, the food is nothing out of the ordinary, but damn it's good. i don't like green beans so i haven't had those beer battered things everyone's having conniptions over. the polenta fries are absolutely perfect: spicy, salty, fried crispy on the outside and velvety on the inside. the aioli that comes along with it makes me want to cry just thinking about how FUCKING GOOD it is. the wings are banging, too: good size, tender meat, extra saucy and a 4/5 on the heat level. i had a burger once, and it was decent, but i won't be having it again.

it's very reasonably priced with most beers on tap being 5 or so dollars. the food is a little more expensive than usual for bar food, but definitely worth it.

There's no tabbouleh, only one option for hummus (as a side) no felafel, the spanikopita comes with chicken too -- odd.

MMRRS6YhVRx_iN5-JhMRYg,Han Dynasty,Philadelphia,PA,1,"Ok. I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like ""why are you here. I have better things to do""?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just ""Hey man, what can I get ya?""  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, ""We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?"". The manager says ""Sure."" The guy then says, ""Can we get few beers down here""? (paraphrasing). The bartender says ""Sure!"" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, ""Hey, just shout and I will get you something"", or ""Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you"". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! 

Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it.

The male bartender was super apathetic and seemingly annoyed by our existence...ex: when taking our brunch order he just walked up and said ""Food?"" In general he couldn't be bothered to interact with us, let alone do it with any hospitality. 

Lousy drinks --  the mimosas are a ripoff. We ordered a carafe, but it was 90% juice, only the neck was topped off w/ sparkling wine. We're not ordering juice here, people, we're ordering drinks! A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference. But here's the kicker -- when a friend of the apathetic bartender sat next to us, she was welcomed with smiles and jovial hospitality, and when she ordered a mimosa guess what she got? 90% sparkling wine, topped with juice! You know, the way they're supposed to be made.

Clearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.

Food-wise, it's meh. The forgettable $13 & $15 entrees didn't come with sides, so you gotta pay extra to have potatoes or grits or bacon w/ those eggs.

PYUI1OJVksGUbCrteU68bw,Bourbon & Branch,Philadelphia,PA,3,"Stopped by here for a drink and some foods. I'll start by saying it is a strange ambiance because it is supposed to be an old speakeasy feel but there is a large screen TV in the front promoting their upstairs music venue. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of bringing music into the mix (one of my fav. local bands actually played there the night after), but it just kind of takes away from the feel they were going for. 

It was nice to see the bar pretty full on a Friday night, definitely not a common occurrence at the former, Liberties.

Moving on. Their menu offers a large variety of food from sandwiches to ""pies"" and salads. Next time I have my eye on the pork belly banh mi sliders. I ordered the Reuban and it was very well executed and was the perfect amount of food for $10. The fiance ordered the smoked turkey sandwich and was also satisfied with his selection. The sandwiches come with a pickle and these house made parmesan chips that are off the chain. (It's $1 to sub in fries). We also ordered fried pickles, they were kind of bland, and doughy (I think the frier wasn't hot enough or they weren't swimming in there long enough). The sauce they came with was also kind of weird and too sweet. 

The craft beer selection is decent but there are no prices listed on the board--and for a good reason. They are entirely too expensive, even for nolibs.

I had the Beef Bourgogne and my wife had the spare ribs.  Both were absolutely excellent!!!

The walking path is paved and flat, so it is not challenging / is safe for seniors. I would guess the entire oval-shaped loop would be around 3/4 of a mile - it was a lovely slow 20 minute walk.

hkh5iyDeGLNhu-JUQFRE1Q,Royal Sonesta New Orleans,New Orleans,LA,1,"My entire experience with the Royal Sonesta in New Orleans was a disappointment from booking to check out with the exception of a few nice employees.  I was staying with a group (we had a group block) for a friend's 40th.  The online portal wouldn't allow me to book a room for less than a four night stay and the telephone operators couldn't offer me the group rate either.  I had to call the group sales person four (4) times to get the rate.  Why four times? She doesn't return calls (I tried over a week and did not call her multiple times over the course of a day).  I had to get someone else in the department to handle it.  Several days after I was booked, the person I had been calling finally called and told me I had the wrong rate (at least she got me a cheaper rate).

The top of my comforter had some sort of faded red stain on it (hurricane/fruit punch spill).  It was obvious and should have resulted in the comforter getting tossed.  I expect more when I'm not staying at a Days Inn.  I didn't complain because I had already unpacked and it was a relatively minor issue that I probably would have overlooked if not for what happened.

2nd night there, I left my hotel room around 6 PM to find a room service tray with empty food sitting in the hall.  That tray was still there at 2 AM and 8 AM.  That's right, 14 hours later.  So for those of you that think I'm being petty - hold on to your seats because the incompetence train is rolling into town.  

As I am packing up the morning after night 2, I find my toiletry bag had been moved to behind the towels underneath the vanity.  Why in the world would  someone do that?  Then to top it off, my ziplock bag for my toiletries was  gone.  It was inside my toiletry bag.  I assume that it fell out when housekeeping moved my bag and she decided to throw it out.  Strike 1 (but still minor and I probably would have commented to the registration on check out).

Then I cannot locate my Downy wrinkle spray.  Small bottle, goes in the ziplock bag works wonders taking out wrinkles.  I scoured my room for this spray bottle but couldn't find it.  Strike 2

Now, I am packing my gear and clothes and can't find my heart rate strap that pairs to my Garmin devices.  I had left it draped over my chair on top of my workout clothes so that it could dry.  I literally checked ever part of the room for it.  Couldn't find it anywhere.  However, I did find one of my iPad chargers and apple pencil thrown that I left on my dresser placed into a drawer of one of the nightstands (as you might surmise I didn't put them in there, nor did I put the local magazines that were on my dresser in their either). Neither my iPad nor my two sets of expensive headphones were touched.  Big strike 3

I called for a manager, security came instead.  They were polite, took copious notes, and downloaded the entry logs from the door.

I take what's left of my stuff & leave it in the host's suite (stepping over the room service tray to get there).  I proceed to check out - about 45 minutes after the security guards leave.

At this point I had not been given a summary of charges.  I tell the registration desk host that I wish to speak with the front end manager and I wanted to check-out.   She asked for my room number and said you have charges at (lists 5-7 places int he hotel) and asks is that ok?  I said I need to see the charges but where is the manager.  She said that she didn't hear me ask for the manager and then the other person said that she hadn't either.  I suggested next time they don't use their phones when talking to customers.  She said that the manager will bring a copy of the bill.

A few minutes later the manager, Randy, comes over but without a copy of the bill.  I explained the situation - he asked me how much the heart rate monitor cost and deducted that amount, and only that amount, from the bill.  Not exactly a great move towards satisfying a clearly annoyed customer.

Then I get handed the actual bill.  There are 4 charges on there totaling a little shy of $100 that are for two restaurants, a bar, and a coffee shop that I hadn't been too.  In fact two of the charges were when I was with the party in the suite and a third was when I was half way across town.  I told them that I had to leave for a tour, circled the four questionable charges, and asked them to look into them while I'm gone and refused to check out.  When I returned around 1:30, randy was working the front desk.  He produced two of the receipts - lo & behold - someone was using my name and room.  The signature wasn't close.   Randy immediately removed the charges.  Again, no accommodation was offered.

It's a nice looking hotel, maybe three to four stars but I would never stay here again and caution anyone that does to refuse housekeeping and closely monitor their room charges.

uKAbrDSJJzZliY1Yqu5KxQ,Scannicchio's,Philadelphia,PA,5,"When it comes to South Philly dining, Scannicchio's is a really great place to eat.  First off, it is BYOB which is nice, and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  It is also right near the Broad and Oregon stop of SEPTA so you can take the train one stop and you are down at the stadiums, which is nice.  It's maybe a block from the entrance on the other side of the street. Also after 6 PM you can street park for free nearby so if you are going to a game, free parking and just have to pay for the Septa.  The service is fast and smooth and I have tried many different things.  The filet is solid, and the gnocchi is really good, but I recommend getting it not baked because I think it is better that way and the waiter actually told me that too.  Their spaghetti and meatballs are solid and their bread is really good.  The caesar dressing is good and their salad is as well.  They get you in and out at a nice rate, where you usually are not waiting forever but you don't feel rushed either.  It is family owned and run, so it's not a chain and it offers really good food at reasonable prices especially considering it's a BYOB.  The chicken picatta is also solid, I've had that a few times, they give you nice portions too so I've never left the restaurant hungry.  If you are looking to eat someplace before a game, I highly recommend Scannicchio's.  They are conveniently located with good food and quality service.

- Convenient for when you're looking to feed an overworked sleep-deprived film crew at 6AM on a Sunday on a tight budget

Cons:
- Food is so bad that even overworked sleep-deprived film crew would rather starve

Lots of flavors--around 25--are just the first option available. Then, one flavor, 2, or 3? What size? Chocolate lover, it's here. Fruit-a-holic? No problem. Wanna go to Italy with the flavor, too? Easy.

I don't think it's possible to leave Frost without a smile on your face and a happy belly...if you do, well, you're not like anyone I know.

SERVICE:
-Was good.



LOCATION:
-Ocean view, of course!



FOOD:
-CLAM CHOWDER: by far one of the worst clam chowder I've had in a while. If you're on a pier and offer clam chowder, you better make it good!! To be fair, I was at Old Fisherman's wharf the weekend before and then I had Pike's Place Chowder up in Seattle within the last year. Did not like the thick chowder texture. It was thick in the wrong way, where it was separating into chunks after 10 mins of eating. The clam taste was not infused very well into the soup either, it was 2 independent flavors from each other. The soup was herb-y flavored, more so than clam flavored.

-CRAB CAKES: the worst crab cake I've ever had! I usually love crab cakes, but this one BARELY tasted like crab. Probably because of all the spice they put into it. If anything it almost had a slight curry taste. For a SEAFOOD restaurant ON a pier, I was expecting nice fresh chunks of sweet crab meat!! NONE of that, the crab was really fine (almost like canned?? texture) and there was absolutely NO sweet crab here, just spice flavoring. I was better off feeding $14 to a seagull.

-FRESH CLAMS IN BROTH: this was the saving grace of the entire meal. The clams were sooo fresh, super sweet and great texture! The broth had a little too much white wine & not enough garlic for my taste. It was also on the salty side, but the clams! OMG, the clams!!! One of the clams was bad though (dead taste) but the rest were fresh.",2014-07-14,NEGATIVE,0.997141420841217

We didn't have bottle service or anything special.  We had some free tickets because of going to Fantasies in Chocolate so we expected to go in, check out the place and then head out.  But instead we stayed for about an hour.  I did my white man overbite shuffle and then let my wife tear up the dance floor looking smoking hot and happy.  Nothing makes a man happier than seeing his wife enjoying herself.

We didn't get any drinks because we knew we would be driving soon enough, but I did get a few waters and the bar staff was super friendly and helpful and hardworking.  The place wasn't slammed, so that may have been part of it.  But the price for a vodka tonic my friend bought wasn't shocking considering the venue.  $11.

The music had a decent blend to please most. Even some of the remixes and mashups of the current songs were really cool.  The hip hop did NOT please me, but I know it pleases others so it's cool just as long as it's got a good balance of other musical styles.

This by far is the best club for decor in Reno.  Large floor that can handle the crowds.  Too many of the other clubs in town are sardine cans.  I will say the music did seem a little loud for me, but my birthday puts me in my mid 40's maybe I am just an old fart that can't handle loud as much as I used to.  But at least that's a good warning to the other old farts that might be heading to ""da club"".

After doing this trial run, I'm pretty sure we will be heading back down to Lex in the future...my only concern is the dress code.  This time I was in a Tux, next time I don't know if my closet can make the grade.

Oh, and one last heads up, if your relationship has an insecure woman in it, this might not be the best club to hit up.  There is guy ""eyecandy"" up on platforms everywhere.

I first went here back in 2012 to look for a new car and was not happy with the knowledge of the sales agent or the staff in general, bought from Garnett VW instead. I did start to use them for service because of proximity. 

Recently took in my car for new tires and replacement of the parking break switch. When I left the air pressure light is on as well as the airbag light. I wasn't able to return to the shop until a month and a half later. They threatened to charge me $118 inspection even though the airbag light wasn't on when I brought it to them and there is currently a recall for it! In the words of their service personnel: ""if the issue is not related to the recall we will charge you the inspection fee."" 

These guys are going to make a buck off you no matter what. The fact that their service staff failed to reset the air pressure sensor after replacing tires speaks to their competence. And yet they won't give their customer the benefit of a doubt with an air bag light that is much more likely that either they caused or is part of the recall.

The amenities are great, but even with the Expedia package deal on flight/hotel, I gasped at the price for the room we had. After considering the hotel's location in the French Quarter, it makes a lot of sense though, and turned to be worth it. It's walking distance from The Court of Two Sisters, Cafe du Monde, and many local shops I enjoyed browsing, including a wonderful knitting shop called the Quarter Stitch. Harrah's is a couple of blocks away and if you're not up for walking, there is a cab stand on the corner.

Since this hotel encompasses an entire city block, it is home to a gift shop, a couple of restaurants including the lovely Begue's, as well as multiple bars. At the Mystick Den we saw an amazing jazz show featuring vocalist Betty Shirley. If she's playing, do not miss her.

Dear families, I've heard that if you stay on a room that faces out to Bourbon Street on the weekends, it can be quite loud. We were lucky to get an inside room facing the courtyard and pool.

5 stars for the food and portions. Wine list a little overpriced...

They lost one star and ended up with 4 because the waiter didn't quite know if the plate had anything hot on it which I specifically asked NOT to have on my plate. Not into hot and spicy foods... Sure enough on a bite my head was nearly burned off to the neck from some burning hot green pepper in the mix... so I didn't appreciate that. That's a slack oversight on the part of the waiter. He obviously didn't mention it to the kitchen.


For lunches and brunches they have a nice outdoor seating area as well. Also a full bar inside. They also have a totally separate cute little building, a private VIP dining area for parties / meetings and such but with a $500 min spend.

We had a salmon and a seared sea bass entree. So, for two with an appetizer, two glasses of fine Napa Valley wine, a port and dessert to finish up our total bill with tip came to $100.",2009-05-19,NEGATIVE,0.9901334047317505

5kZtETKu37RuwHATrB4a5g,City Fitness - Graduate Hospital,Philadelphia,PA,2,"The gym part of City Fitness is better than most, good equipment, clean, variety, it's a nice gym. I find the rates reasonable and have been a member since they opened and will continue to be a member. So, for the rating I give the gym at CF a 3.5 star, I give MBSC a 1.5 star for an overall 2.5 star rating.

MBSC review: I thought I would kick it up a notch so joined the MBSC thrive program at CF on South Street and tried it for three months. Trainers really aren't ""personal"" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like/don't like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour's time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I've ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don't. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.

If you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don't care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won't like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it's $200+/mo program.",2014-01-17,POSITIVE,0.9258554577827454

k3lTRgvPvYUI-cX7_TAqNA,University Club of Santa Barbara,Santa Barbara,CA,5,"We had the most perfect wedding, and it is all because we chose the most perfect venue!  When deciding on our venue, pretty much our only prospect was the Riviera Mansion.  Once I found out that they had the date we were hoping for, we booked it immediately without looking into any other venues.  Having never planned a wedding before, I was at first very overwhelmed with all of the details that are involved.  One of the best things about the Riviera Mansion is that they provide all tables and chairs, linens and everything else for the table, unless you want to rent your own.  They do all of the food and beverage and have a very extensive food and drink menu with any option you can imagine!  You can put together your perfect menu and package.  

We had our ceremony there as well, and it was so beautiful and convenient!  Our reception was flawless, and the food was absolutely amazing (our guests are still talking about the food!)  We danced all night until 11:30pm which is a much later last call time than most other venues and hotels.  

The very best part about the Riviera Mansion is the staff.  I cannot say enough good things about everyone that works there.  Breanna is the event coordinator and she was so thorough throughout the entire process!  She took time to meet with me several times and gave me tons of advice and was there all day long the day of the wedding making sure everything was perfect.  Eli, the food and beverage director was there the entire night and took care of everything!  He was so accommodating and made sure that we had everything we needed. Chef Harley and his team made the best food, and the servers and bartenders took care of us all night long and were so sweet to all of our guests.  They made the experience what it was and it is rare these days to find such impeccable service from start to finish, but we sure found it!

I would HIGHLY recommend the Riviera Mansion to anyone, and I plan on telling all of my engaged friends to seriously consider having it there.  Having been to many other weddings in Santa Barbara, I really do think that this is the best wedding venue in town.  It is so much more exclusive than having it at a hotel, and much more convenient than doing it at a private estate.  We had the entire mansion to ourselves all day long which was so helpful.

It wasn't very good and had a weird spiced flavor that I couldn't quite distinguish but it definitely did not enhance the soup at all.  We also got the Rueben which I was told was excellent and much better than the Rueben he previously ordered the day before in New Jersey.  It also came w/ a heaping amount of fries.

It was missing the spices that are signature of Turkish coffee (namely cardamom), and they treated it like conventional instant coffee (i.e. they poured a full mug of hot water with the grinds, which inevitably overflowed and spilled down the sides of the mug). It was just not an enjoyable drink. Turkish coffee ought to be something one can enjoy in smaller doses -- less is truly more in that case.

w520vYWEpEYBf90rSr9NVA,The Smiling Elephant,Nashville,TN,2,"Decided to come out and try it after reading rave reviews online and am sad to say that it did not live up to it's hype at all! 

The place itself is very quaint and the staff are so incredibly friendly and it really makes me wish that I'd liked the food more. Having said that, the restaurant was quite cramped and I found myself squeezed between a wall and another patron, which was not fun.

Onto the food, my friend and I ordered three things to share:

Fresh Rolls - These come out immediately because they've been pre-prepared and are just chilling in a little glass case. I was disappointed that they didn't come with any shrimp or pork filling and they were just stuffed with bean sprouts. This is a personal thing, but I hate bean sprouts! And they cost $4! Definitely not worth it.

Pad Thai with Shrimp - Ah, the famous pad thai. I've been to Thailand on numerous occasions as my family lives in Malaysia currently and I've had pad thai dishes in Bangkok and Phuket a number of times so I had high expectations for this particular dish. But it really didn't deliver. It's very obviously stated on the menu that this was going to be ""authentic"" and ""not-Americanized"" but compared to actual pad thai that I've had in Thailand, this is not authentic by any means. It is quite bland and filled with bean sprouts to the point where it has me questioning the $18 price tag. Also the bean noodles are so weird texturally and they don't soak up flavor as well as rice noodles would have. The dish was just so whatever. There's no other way to describe it. It's not good but I wouldn't say it's horrible. It's just whatever. It doesn't do anything for me.

Green Curry with Chicken - This dish was again, bland and very diluted. I didn't get hit with a mouthful of intense flavor or spices or anything. It was just very milky and the rice on the side was a bit dry and clumpy. The best thing about the dish was that it was filled with beautiful, colorful, crisp vegetables. But the curry itself just wasn't as good as I'd hoped.

I really don't think that I'll be coming back here again. It is so overpriced for such bland food and in my opinion, incredibly overhyped. I know Thai food quite well. I've traveled to Bangkok twice and to Phuket every year since I was 12 years old. Thai food is supposed to be flavorful and rich and spicy and this place was not any of that at all.",2014-07-31,NEGATIVE,0.968042254447937

I'm sure there are other yelpers who would be better to give you that TRUE BBQ opinion. This is just the average white chick from north of the mason-dickson review. 

I like pulled pork and mac and cheese and coleslaw. So that is what I got. The pulled pork is was chopped up very finely (like mushy) but tasted okay, just looked funny and kinda gross. The BBQ Sauce was simple, nothing that blew me away (I've been told it sweet baby rays sauce you can buy at Kroger) The Mac and cheese, ugh okay, and coleslaw was vinegary with ALOT of celery salt.

I tried a sample of my friends potato salad and it was awesome. I would most def get that again. We also got a ooey gooey bar that was so good - full off sugar and butter and Paula Deen Goodness. I would probably go there JUST for the gooey bar. 

Younger looking/college age crowd here. Small bar with drinks in mason jars. Service was pretty fast. Only one soft drink machine right near the line to order so the organization of that is a bit people stepping all over each other.

To our pleasant surprise, this place also serves some popular dishes, such as bun Bo hue (spicy noodle soup), pho, beef stew (bo kho), etc.  We ordered these dishes and they were authentic Vietnamese.   The place was spic and span, including the bathroom.  Since we were there around 11AM and probably were their first customers of the day, we don't know how well the placed is kept clean later during the day.  As for banh mi, we asked for the condiments to kept separate from the sandwiches, as they were not going to be consumed right away.  The folks behind the counter separated each ingredient in its own bag so as to make it easy for us to prepare our sandwiches when we're ready to eat.  Nice touch!!!  The meats for the sandwiches at Seasons Cafe and Bakery were in good quantity, which puts the banh mi shops in Northern VA to shame.

I went there with my girlfriend for the arcade, but we decided to walk around for fun anyway.  It's a very depressing place that is trying desperately to stay modern, but fails in every aspect.  For a Sunday afternoon, the mall was practically deserted, and the few people who did populate the mall were kind of, uh... sketchy?  I was reminded of the desolate mall the zombies populated in the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" movie, to give you a mental image.  A huge number of store fronts were empty, which added to the creepy vibe.

Came here recently at around 7pm on a Sunday night, and I suppose they were running out of supplies at the end of the week. 

THAT ASIDE, this meal was delish. My favorite from the evening was the Sweet Potato Hash with bacon, sausage and  the de rigueur fried egg. Also had some sort of brussel sprouts dish with crispy shallots and pecorino romano (also really tasty).

GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw,Luke,New Orleans,LA,5,"Great restaurant!  Just ate here for breakfast this morning after having eaten here the other night for dinner (which was our first night in New Orleans).  For dinner the other night, the service was excellent.  For breakfast this morning, somehow it was even better.  I'll start with this morning's breakfast.

Our server, Jackson, was completely on top of his game.  I cannot say enough how much I appreciated not only the excellent service he provided us, but I could tell from observing him with other tables that he is an outstanding server, because I noticed other people trying to order items not really on the menu, and in each case he was extremely accommodating.  You don't always find that attitude and approach in restaurants these days.  But Jackson just offered to ""make it happen,"" as he put it himself.  That's awesome in and of itself.  In our case, we did go just a bit outside the menu but nothing too outlandish - my wife ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns, plain and simple, and that combination just didn't happen to be on the menu but Jackson was happy to oblige.

For me, the fried chicken on a biscuit with tabasco honey was terrific!  Man, that tabasco honey was great!  And so was the fried chicken, moist, and tasty.  And the biscuit itself was great, too.  And those GRITS, they are also great. Do not touch them.  Don't add butter, pepper, or salt.  Just eat them as is because they have plenty of flavor.

An outstanding breakfast at Luke.  Nice ambiance too.  And I haven't even gotten to dinner.  I must say service was excellent for dinner, and I had shrimp and grits, which was very good, but for the star of the dinner show was the happy hour oysters and shrimp.  SO fresh and delicious and you can't beat the happy hour prices.  Plus those French 75s are delicious and also on the happy hour menu!

The sushi was freshly made and the fellow making it was very friendly and willing to explain it. There was a variety of asian and western offerings.

The brown butter pistachio has a nice nutty flavor with slightly salty salty pistachios, the chocolate glazed is chocolatey yet not overwhelmingly sweet, in fact it's actually quite sinfully dark, and the cookies and cream is sweet and crunchy and delicious. Other than the donuts, I've tried their fries and the fries are delicious. The cheesy fries are good but the cheese has a slightly gritty feel to it.

6I_DA3uqOox50rBvjrQ_-g,Aloft Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,PA,1,"We expected so much more from an SPG Hotel. We stayed at the Aloft because we were in town for a funeral and we are SPG preferred members. However.....this hotel left a lot to be desired. 

We paid in advance online and arrived late in the evening to check-in, the parking lot was packed, we drove around for quite some time to find a space and then walked a short distance to the front doors of the hotel and the lobby was packed! Music playing, people seated at the bar, playing pool and just sort-of hanging out. We were extremely exhausted after driving in from New Jersey. After attending a funeral, repass at the church and then again at the home of the family, it was quite a long day and we were a bit hungry and tired.   

We checked in, paid $10.00 for parking (which I'll talk more about shortly) and asked if they had room service, which they do not and we were given a menu of a place that delivered. We took the elevator to our floor and as soon as we stepped off the elevator we were greeted with dog poop on the floor. As we walked down the hall to our room, we were greeted with the smell of weed, pot, Mary Jane, marijuana or whatever you want to call it. We got into our room and called the front desk and advised them of the dog poop and then placed an order with Femi's pizza for delivery. 

My boyfriend then went down to the hotel bar to grab a drink, as he sat down at the bar there was a woman and man seated beside him and he could hear their entire conversation, the young woman was telling the gentleman her cost for SERVICES, yes, those services! My boyfriend took a few sips of his drink and got up to come back to our room, he was then approached by THREE women who asked him if they could go back to his room with him, he said no thank you, and that he had a girlfriend upstairs that he was going back to, and they said, ""too bad, you could have had some fun tonight"" 

Once back safely our room the food delivery called to say that the hotel would not let me up and that we needed to come down to pick up our food. We ate and went right to sleep. The next morning we woke to the sounds of planes departing and arriving, we showered, dressed and checked out of the hotel. 

As I mentioned earlier, I would tell you about parking. We paid the additional $10.00 for parking as parking was not included. We got to the gate to slide in our paid parking pass and the gate was GONE, their was nothing there and we just drove away and headed back to New Jersey. 

The hotel and rooms are quite trendy, the shower was nice and the complimentary body wash and 2 in1 shampoo and conditioner were nice. However, there was a bit of a sour smell coming from the drain, the bed was pretty basic, I would not want to sleep on it more that one night. The wall unit a/c turned on and off all night, I tried to adjust the temp on the unit itself and it would not adjust. I noticed the thermostat on the wall and tried adjusting it and it did not work either, so I just unplugged the unit.

Rarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice, casual dining experience. The first time I went we were the only ones outside (it looked like it was going to rain... and it did). The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich, she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time, so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable.

My favorite things to order here is the vegan wings, and even though I am a meat eater, they are pretty good.  Also, their desserts are usually on point, more so than their entrees.  They had a smores bread pudding that was to die for that they removed from their menu.

Arrived at 7:00 on a Friday night and got a cozy table for two. The décor is Mediterranean , dimly lit and cozy. This night they had an excellent acoustic guitar player entertaining. 

We started with a cocktail, beer for him, tequila martini for me, while we perused the wine list. Ended up with a decent bottle of Santori Amarone ($85) which was quite good. 

Started with the pate platter which come out with two nice slices of pate and all the accoutrements.  ($9.00) I love pate and this did not disappoint.

We also tried the special tuna trio of the night, a smoked tuna spread on crostini, tuna sashimi and tuna crudo. All very good and fresh although the spread was just kind of a glammed up tuna salad. 

For dinner, after much debate, we went with the Paella for him and the Beef Shortribs for me. The Paella ($29) . we requested it to be crispy (as a true paella should be) and the chef obliged. Unfortunately it made the Paella so dry and overcooked it was not good at all. The shortribs, ($26) with a cabernet barbque sauce was very good. Served with a mini au gratin and fresh asparagus. The ribs were nice and tender 
, the sauce was almost bordering on overdone, almost but not quite. 

For dessert we ordered our fav limencello cake, it was good, but not as good as the craft in St Pete . Ended up at the bar for a couple glasses of Port to quell our dessert craving and get a chance to listen to the guitarist. 

While at the bar we were speaking of our dinners and before you knew it Chef Karim came out to speak with us, apologized for the Paella and told us next time we come in to ask for him personally so he can take care of us. 

You can tell he's a chef/owner that really cares about his clientel. He checked one very table and knew many patrons by their names.

I've been here several times and the attitude of the employees is terrible. The food is decent and there's a good beer selection, but I'm tired of being treated like shit by the too-cool staff. The straw that broke the camel's back was my most recent trip, when a group of us went here after work.
""Hey what are the specials?""
""They're on the board over there."" Points to wall.
""Ah, yeah I can't see those from here, can you just tell me?""
""I mean you can just walk over there... ah, well I guess there is [x,y,z]""
SO there were three specials. Three. Not sixteen or a thousand, three. And my servers idea was that all five of us should go stand awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant to go figure out what they were. If this was a pizza place I would understand. But the food is $15+ a plate, so it's not crazy to think that your server, who presumably enjoys receiving tips, could tell you the specials.
So I went to the bar area hoping to see the manager. I was told that he was ""upstairs"" and that ""he doesn't like to be disturbed. But I guess you could tell me, like, what the issue is, and I could like, ah, tell him later."" 
""Are you the assistant manager or something?""

While I do appreciate them creating a quicker and cheaper lunch for business workers.... the food quality has been sacrificed.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with chips.  I remember their pulled pork being very good, so I felt that was a safe order.  WRONG!  The pulled pork that came out to me might as well have been called ""Shredded Flash Fried Pork"".  There was not a drop of moistness to this at all.  Very crunchy and dry.  It was served with a side of lettuce/tomato/onion, but that would not have aided the sandwich in any way.  The chips were ok, but lacked proper seasoning.  The person who i was sitting next to ordered a burger.  When it came out it looked like a pre-formed/pre-cooked/re-heated mess.  Not like the burgers I remember and loved.  

I know they only changed their menu a few days ago and maybe they are getting used to things.... but this was just not good.  I would rather pay a few more dollars and wait an extra 15 minutes for good food.

Also, it would be helpful for those patrons who don't know about the change yet to maybe have something on the hostess stand that says ""please proceed to the bar to place your order"".    

Definitely a miss on your part Sage.... i used to really enjoy coming here.  I felt it was special when I was able to come.  I really am having second thoughts about the restaurant.com gift certificate that I just purchased...  Maybe dinner will be better.",2012-12-07,NEGATIVE,0.9992793202400208
